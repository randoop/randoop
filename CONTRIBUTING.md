# Contributing to Randoop

Thank you for contributing to the Randoop!  This project is a
community effort of [more than 20
developers](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#credits), plus countless
more people who have contributed bug reports and feature suggestions.  We
couldn't do it without your help.


## Reporting bugs

Please see the [bug
reporting](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/#bug-reporting) section of
the Randoop manual.

If the documentation is incorrect, incomplete, or confusing, that is a
bug, and we want to fix it.  Please report it.


## Submitting changes

Please make a [pull request](https://github.com/randoop/randoop/pulls).  If
you have not made a pull request before, please see ["How to create and
review a GitHub pull
request"](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/github-pull-request.html).

Do you want to contribute to the project, but you are not sure what issue
to fix or what feature to add?  Use the tool in your daily work, and when
you encounter a limitation that bothers you, fix that one.  The ["good
first issue"](https://github.com/randoop/randoop/contribute)
label marks issues that require less deep knowledge and may be appropriate
for a newcomer to the codebase.
