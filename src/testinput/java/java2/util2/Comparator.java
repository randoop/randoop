/**
 * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on some
 * collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such as
 * <tt>Collections.sort</tt>) to allow precise control over the sort order.
 * Comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data
 * structures (such as <tt>TreeSet</tt> or <tt>TreeMap</tt>).<p>
 *
 * The ordering imposed by a Comparator <tt>c</tt> on a set of elements
 * <tt>S</tt> is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if
 * <tt>(compare((Object)e1, (Object)e2)==0)</tt> has the same boolean value as
 * <tt>e1.equals((Object)e2)</tt> for every <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in
 * <tt>S</tt>.<p>
 *
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit Comparator <tt>c</tt>
 * is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set <tt>S</tt>.  If the
 * ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is inconsistent with equals,
 * the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the
 * sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or
 * map), which is defined in terms of <tt>equals</tt>.<p>
 *
 * For example, if one adds two keys <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> such that
 * <tt>(a.equals((Object)b) && c.compare((Object)a, (Object)b) != 0)</tt> to a
 * sorted set with comparator <tt>c</tt>, the second <tt>add</tt> operation
 * will return false (and the size of the sorted set will not increase)
 * because <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are equivalent from the sorted set's
 * perspective.<p>
 *
 * Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to implement
 * <tt>java.io.Serializable</tt>, as they may be used as ordering methods in
 * serializable data structures (like <tt>TreeSet</tt>, <tt>TreeMap</tt>).  In
 * order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if
 * provided) must implement <tt>Serializable</tt>.<p>
 *
 * For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines
 * the <i>total order</i> that a given comparator <tt>c</tt> imposes on a
 * given set of objects <tt>S</tt> is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare((Object)x, (Object)y) &lt;= 0}.
 * </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare((Object)x, (Object)y) == 0}.
 * </pre>
 *
 * It follows immediately from the contract for <tt>compare</tt> that the
 * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on <tt>S</tt>, and that the
 * natural ordering is a <i>total order</i> on <tt>S</tt>.  When we say that
 * the ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the natural ordering is the
 * equivalence relation defined by the objects' <tt>equals(Object)</tt>
 * method(s):<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that x.equals((Object)y)}.
