/**
 * A map that further guarantees that it will be in ascending key order,
 * sorted according to the <i>natural ordering</i> of its keys (see the
 * <tt>Comparable</tt> interface), or by a comparator provided at sorted map
 * creation time.  This order is reflected when iterating over the sorted
 * map's collection views (returned by the <tt>entrySet</tt>, <tt>keySet</tt>
 * and <tt>values</tt> methods).  Several additional operations are provided
 * to take advantage of the ordering.  (This interface is the map analogue of
 * the <tt>SortedSet</tt> interface.)<p>
 *
 * All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the <tt>Comparable</tt>
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such keys must be <i>mutually comparable</i>: <tt>k1.compareTo(k2)</tt> (or
 * <tt>comparator.compare(k1, k2)</tt>) must not throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt> for any elements <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> in
 * the sorted map.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.<p>
 *
 * Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if
 * the sorted map is to correctly implement the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  (See
 * the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface or <tt>Comparator</tt> interface for a
 * precise definition of <i>consistent with equals</i>.)  This is so because
 * the <tt>Map</tt> interface is defined in terms of the <tt>equals</tt>
 * operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its
 * <tt>compareTo</tt> (or <tt>compare</tt>) method, so two keys that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,
 * equal.  The behavior of a tree map <i>is</i> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.<p>
 *
 * All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four
 * "standard" constructors: 1) A void (no arguments) constructor, which
 * creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the <i>natural order</i> of
 * its keys.  2) A constructor with a single argument of type
 * <tt>Comparator</tt>, which creates an empty sorted map sorted according to
 * the specified comparator.  3) A constructor with a single argument of type
 * <tt>Map</tt>, which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as
 * its argument, sorted according to the keys' natural ordering.  4) A
 * constructor with a single argument of type sorted map, which creates a new
 * sorted map with the same key-value mappings and the same ordering as the
 * input sorted map.  There is no way to enforce this recommendation (as
 * interfaces cannot contain constructors) but the SDK implementation
 * (TreeMap) complies.<p>
 *
 * This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
