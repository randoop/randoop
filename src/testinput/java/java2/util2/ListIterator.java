/**

 * An iterator for lists that allows the programmer
 * to traverse the list in either direction, modify
 * the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator's
 * current position in the list. A <TT>ListIterator</TT>
 * has no current element; its <I>cursor position</I> always
 * lies between the element that would be returned by a call
 * to <TT>previous()</TT> and the element that would be
 * returned by a call to <TT>next()</TT>. In a list of
 * length <TT>n</TT>, there are <TT>n+1</TT> valid
 * index values, from <TT>0</TT> to <TT>n</TT>, inclusive.
 * <PRE>
