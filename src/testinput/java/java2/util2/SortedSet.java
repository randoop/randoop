/**
 * A set that further guarantees that its iterator will traverse the set in
 * ascending element order, sorted according to the <i>natural ordering</i> of
 * its elements (see Comparable), or by a Comparator provided at sorted set
 * creation time.  Several additional operations are provided to take
 * advantage of the ordering.  (This interface is the set analogue of
 * SortedMap.)<p>
 *
 * All elements inserted into an sorted set must implement the Comparable
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified Comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such elements must be <i>mutually comparable</i>: <tt>e1.compareTo(e2)</tt>
 * (or <tt>comparator.compare(e1, e2)</tt>) must not throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt> for any elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in
 * the sorted set.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.<p>
 *
 * Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if
 * the sorted set is to correctly implement the <tt>Set</tt> interface.  (See
 * the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface or <tt>Comparator</tt> interface for a
 * precise definition of <i>consistent with equals</i>.)  This is so because
 * the <tt>Set</tt> interface is defined in terms of the <tt>equals</tt>
 * operation, but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its
 * <tt>compareTo</tt> (or <tt>compare</tt>) method, so two elements that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set,
 * equal.  The behavior of a sorted set <i>is</i> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the <tt>Set</tt> interface.<p>
 *
 * All general-purpose sorted set implementation classes should provide four
 * "standard" constructors: 1) A void (no arguments) constructor, which
 * creates an empty sorted set sorted according to the <i>natural order</i> of
 * its elements.  2) A constructor with a single argument of type
 * <tt>Comparator</tt>, which creates an empty sorted set sorted according to
 * the specified comparator.  3) A constructor with a single argument of type
 * <tt>Collection</tt>, which creates a new sorted set with the same elements
 * as its argument, sorted according to the elements' natural ordering.  4) A
 * constructor with a single argument of type <tt>SortedSet</tt>, which
 * creates a new sorted set with the same elements and the same ordering as
 * the input sorted set.  There is no way to enforce this recommendation (as
 * interfaces cannot contain constructors) but the SDK implementation (the
 * <tt>TreeSet</tt> class) complies.<p>
 *
 * This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
