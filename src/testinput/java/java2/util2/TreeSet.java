/**
 * This class implements the <tt>Set</tt> interface, backed by a
 * <tt>TreeMap</tt> instance.  This class guarantees that the sorted set will
 * be in ascending element order, sorted according to the <i>natural order</i>
 * of the elements (see <tt>Comparable</tt>), or by the comparator provided at
 * set creation time, depending on which constructor is used.<p>
 *
 * This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic
 * operations (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt> and <tt>contains</tt>).<p>
 *
 * Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit
 * comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if it is to
 * correctly implement the <tt>Set</tt> interface.  (See <tt>Comparable</tt>
 * or <tt>Comparator</tt> for a precise definition of <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>.)  This is so because the <tt>Set</tt> interface is defined in
 * terms of the <tt>equals</tt> operation, but a <tt>TreeSet</tt> instance
 * performs all key comparisons using its <tt>compareTo</tt> (or
 * <tt>compare</tt>) method, so two keys that are deemed equal by this method
 * are, from the standpoint of the set, equal.  The behavior of a set
 * <i>is</i> well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it
 * just fails to obey the general contract of the <tt>Set</tt> interface.<p>
 *
 * <b>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</b> If multiple
 * threads access a set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies
 * the set, it <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.  This is typically
 * accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates
 * the set.  If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
 * <tt>Collections.synchronizedSet</tt> method.  This is best done at creation
 * time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the set: <pre>
 *     SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet(...));
 * </pre><p>
 *
 * The Iterators returned by this class's <tt>iterator</tt> method are
 * <i>fail-fast</i>: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is
 * created, in any way except through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt>
 * method, the iterator will throw a <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt>.
 * Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
 * and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
 * an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i><p>
 *
 * This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
