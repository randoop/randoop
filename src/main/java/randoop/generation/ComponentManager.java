/**
 * Stores and provides means to access the component sequences generated during a run of Randoop.
 * "Component sequences" are sequences that Randoop uses to create larger sequences. The collection
 * of sequences is also called Randoop's "pool".
 *
 * <p>This class manages different collections of component sequences:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>General components that can be used as input to any method in any class.
 *   <li>Class literals: components representing literal values that apply only to a specific class
 *       and should not be used as inputs to other classes.
 *   <li>Package literals: analogous to class literals but at the package level.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>SEED SEQUENCES. Seed sequences are sequences that were not created during the generation
 * process but obtained via other means. They include (1) sequences passed via the constructor, (2)
 * class literals, and (3) package literals. The only different treatment of seed sequences is
 * during calls to the clearGeneratedSequences() method, which removes only general, non-seed
 * components from the collection.
