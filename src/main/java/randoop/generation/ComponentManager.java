 * <p>This class manages different collections of component sequences:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>General components that can be used as input to any method in any class.
 *   <li>Class literals: components representing literal values that apply only to a specific class
 *       and should not be used as inputs to other classes.
 *   <li>Package literals: analogous to class literals but at the package level.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>SEED SEQUENCES. Seed sequences are the initial sequences provided to the generation process.
 * They include (1) sequences passed via the constructor, (2) class literals, and (3) package
 * literals. The only different treatment of seed sequences is during calls to the
 * clearGeneratedSequences() method, which removes only general, non-seed components from the
 * collection.
