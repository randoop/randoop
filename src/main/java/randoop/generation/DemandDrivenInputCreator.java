/**
 * Constructs inputs for types that some method in the SUT needs but is not returned by any SUT
 * method.
 *
 * <p>Randoop normally works bottom-up: it abandons a method call if inputs aren't available. This
 * top-down demand-driven approach gives different treatment to an input whose type is a
 * non-SUT-returned class.
 *
 * <p>Consider a class T which is not returned by any method or constructor declared in the SUT.
 * When an input of type T is needed, the demand-driven algorithm calls every accessible constructor
 * or static method in T that can produce T once (recursively building its inputs if needed,
 * possibly including values of non-SUT-parameter, non-SUT-returned classes). Those results form the
 * candidate set from which Randoop can choose.
 *
 * <p>This creator relies on {@link ComponentManager}, which holds the main {@link
 * SequenceCollection}, to fetch and store existing sequences. Whenever demand-driven needs to build
 * inputs, it queries the ComponentManager's sequence collection for reusable values and adds any
 * newly constructed sequences back into it.
 *
 * <p>TODO: Later, look for methods in every known class that produce T, not just in T itself. This
 * would be an extension of the GRT algorithm.
 *
 * <p>The main entry point is {@link #createSequencesForType}.
 *
 * <p>Definitions:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>SUT class
 *   <dd>A SUT class is a class that the user specified on the command line to be tested. SUT stands
 *       for "software under test".
 *   <dt>SUT-returned class
 *   <dd>a class that is the return type for some accessible method or constructor in the SUT.
 *   <dt>SUT-parameter class
 *   <dd>a class that is a formal parameter for some accessible method or constructor in the SUT.
 *   <dt>SUT-parameter-only class
 *   <dd>a SUT-parameter class that is not a SUT-returned class
 *   <dt>SUT-parameter-only-closure class
 *   <dd>either:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>a SUT-parameter-only class, or
 *         <li>a closure-only class: is a formal parameter for some method in a
 *             SUT-parameter-only-closure class. Being a closure-only class does not imply the class
 *             is SUT-returned or SUT-parameter; it may be either, both, or neither. (TODO: after
 *             optimizing to skip exploring methods whose parameter values are already available
 *             from the main sequence collection, restrict this to nonâ€“SUT-returned parameters)
 *       </ul>
 *   <dt>non-instantiable class
 *   <dd>a class C that contains no method whose return type is C. (TODO: Later, permit
 *       instantiation via any method in a known class that produces C, not just methods in C
 *       itself. This would be an extension of the GRT algorithm.)
 * </dl>
 *
 * None of these subsumes the others: there may be SUT classes that are not SUT-returned, and there
 * may be SUT-returned classes that are not SUT classes.
 *
 * <p>This class implements the "Detective" component from the ASE 2015 paper <a
