/**
 * Implements the Bloodhound component, as described by the paper "GRT: Program-Analysis-Guided
 * Random Testing" by Ma et. al (appears in ASE 2015):
 * https://people.kth.se/~artho/papers/lei-ase2015.pdf .
 *
 * <p>Bloodhound computes a weight for each method under test by taking a weighted combination of
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the uncovered branch ratio and
 *   <li>the ratio between the number of times the method has been successfully invoked (to be the
 *       last statement of a new regression test) and the maximum number of times any method under
 *       test has been successfully invoked.
 * </ul>
 *
 * A method is "successfully invoked" when a method under test is used to create a new sequence and
 * the sequence is kept as a regression test. An alternative definition of "successful invocations"
 * is the total number of times the method appears in any regression test. Both definitions are
 * consistent with the description in the GRT paper. We believe our implementation, which uses the
 * first definition, is likely what was intended by the authors of the GRT paper.
