/**
 * Implements the Orienteering component, as described by the paper "GRT: Program-Analysis-Guided
 * Random Testing" by Ma et. al (appears in ASE 2015):
 * https://people.kth.se/~artho/papers/lei-ase2015.pdf .
 *
 * <p>Biases input selection towards sequences that have lower execution cost. Execution cost is
 * measured by the number of method calls in a sequence and the time it takes to execute.
 *
 * <p>Our implementation of Orienteering differs from that described in the GRT paper in that we do
 * not measure the time of every execution of a sequence. Instead, we assume that a sequence's
 * execution time is equal to the execution time of its first run. We believe this assumption is
 * reasonable since a sequence does not take any inputs (it is self-contained), so its execution
 * time probably does not differ greatly between separate runs.
 *
 * <p>The GRT paper also does not describe how to handle input sequences that have an execution time
 * of zero, such as one that only includes the assignment of a primitive type {@code byte byte0 =
 * (byte)1;}. We assign these input sequences an execution time of 1 nanosecond to prevent division
 * by zero when computing weights.
 *
 * <p>The GRT paper also does not describe how to handle input sequences that have not yet been
 * selected. We start ecah input sequences with a selection count of 1 to prevent division by zero
 * when computing weights.
