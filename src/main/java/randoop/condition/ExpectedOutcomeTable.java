/**
 * An ExpectedOutcomeTable collects all the permitted outcomes for a set of methods (where the
 * methods are all in an overriding relationship) and a set of prestate values. The set of expected
 * or permitted outcomes is those whose preconditions or conditions are satisfied.
 *
 * <p>A method implementation must satisfy not only the specification written on it, but also any
 * written on method declarations that it overrides or implements.
 *
 * <p>One possible implementation would be to record a collection of single-method outcomes, where
 * each single-method outcome represents checks of the prestate {@link
 * ExecutableBooleanExpression}s: for the {@link randoop.condition.specification.Precondition}, the
 * {@link GuardPropertyPair}, and {@link GuardThrowsPair} for an operation call.
 * ExpectedOutcomeTable is not implemented that way: it does some pre-processing and throws away
 * certain of the information as it is added. (It's unclear whether this is the best choice, or
 * whether the more straightforward implementation would enable simpler and more understandable code
 * at the cost of a bit of extra processing to be done later.)
 *
 * <p>This implementation records:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Whether any guard expression for the {@link randoop.condition.specification.Precondition}
 *       fails, or all are satisfied.
 *   <li>The set of {@link randoop.condition.specification.ThrowsCondition} objects for expected
 *       exceptions. An exception is expected if the guard of a {@link GuardThrowsPair} is
 *       satisfied.
 *   <li>The expected postcondition (an {@link ExecutableBooleanExpression}), if any.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>To create an ExpectedOutcomeTable, call {@link
 * ExecutableSpecification#checkPrestate(Object[])}. To use an ExpectedOutcomeTable, call {@link
 * #addPostCheckGenerator(TestCheckGenerator)} to create a {@link TestCheckGenerator} that
 * classifies a method call as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>For each table entry with a non-empty expected exception set
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>If an exception is thrown by the call and the thrown exception is a member of the
 *             set, then classify as {@link randoop.main.GenInputsAbstract.BehaviorType#EXPECTED}.
 *         <li>If an exception is thrown by the call and the thrown exception is not a member of the
 *             set, classify as {@link randoop.main.GenInputsAbstract.BehaviorType#ERROR} (because
 *             the specification required an exception to be thrown, but it was not thrown).
 *         <li>If no exception is thrown, then classify as {@link
 *             randoop.main.GenInputsAbstract.BehaviorType#ERROR}.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>If for each table entry, the preconditions failed, classify as {@link
 *       randoop.main.GenInputsAbstract.BehaviorType#INVALID}.
 *   <li>For each table entry where all preconditions were satisfied, check the corresponding normal
 *       post-condition property, if one exists. If any such property fails, then classify as {@link
 *       randoop.main.GenInputsAbstract.BehaviorType#ERROR}.
 *   <li>Otherwise, don't classify (let classification fall through).
 * </ol>
