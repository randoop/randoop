/**
 * A Sequence that produces a tuple or collection of values, all of the same type.
 *
 * <p>To make a new sequence requires choosing an operation, choosing a value (really, a
 * previously-created sequence and one of its outputs) for each of the operation's inputs, and then
 * concatenating all the input sequences along with the new operation. Most operations take a
 * well-defined number and type of inputs. This helper class supports calling operations that take a
 * variable number of inputs -- namely, array and list creation.
 *
 * <p>Ordinarily:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each Sequence consists of a single operation (the final statement) and its inputs. Those
 *       inputs are individually chosen and may be of different types, because the operation takes
 *       multiple types of arguments.
 *   <li>Each Sequence creates multiple values: the value produced by its last statement, and the
 *       values that might be side-effected by its last statement.
 *   <li>Each valid Sequence is output as a regression test. All of its values are in the pool, and
 *       when Randoop needs a value, it might choose any of them. Only one of its outputs is used
 *       when it is used as a component in a larger sequence.
 * </ul>
 *
 * This sequence is different.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It is created as the concatenation of valid sequences, without an operation at the end.
 *   <li>Its outputs are one value from each of the sequences that created it.
 *   <li>It is not output as a regression test, but is used as one of the inputs to an array- or
 *       list-producing operation that will be output. All of its outputs are used.
 * </ul>
