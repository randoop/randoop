/**
 * List implementation used by Randoop to store the sequence of <code>Statement</code>s making up a
 * Sequence.
 *
 * <p>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
 *
 * <p>Randoop's main generator ({@link randoop.generation.ForwardGenerator ForwardGenerator})
 * creates new sequences by concatenating existing sequences and appending a statement at the end. A
 * naive implementation of concatenation copies the elements of the concatenated sub-sequences into
 * a new list. The first implementation of Sequence concatenation took this approach.
 *
 * <p>When profiling Randoop, we observed that naive concatenation took up a large portion of the
 * tool's running time, and the component set (i.e. the set of stored sequences used to create more
 * sequences) quickly exhausted the memory available.
 *
 * <p>To improve memory and time efficiency, we now do concatenation differently. We store the list
 * of statements in a Sequence in a SimpleList, an abstract class that has three subclasses:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ArrayListSimpleList}: a typical list is stored as an array list.
 *   <li>{@link ListOfLists}: a list that only stores pointers to its constituent sub-lists.
 *   <li>{@link OneMoreElementList}: stores a SimpleList plus one additional final element.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When concatenating N Sequences to create a new sequence, we store the concatenated sequence
 * statements in a ListofLists, which takes space (and creation time) proportional to N, not to the
 * length of the new sequence.
 *
 * <p>When extending a Sequence with a new statement, we store the old sequence's statements plus
 * the new statement in a {@code OneMoreElementList}, which takes up only 2 references in memory
 * (and constant creation time).
