This directory src/docs contains the editable version of the files in the
project pages directory [docs](../docs).

Please only edit documentation files within this directory.
The corresponding files in the project pages directory should not be edited.

Note: the Javadoc in [docs/api](../../docs/api) is generated from the source
code in [src/main/java](../main/java), and is not part of this directory.
See the configuration of the javadoc task in the [build script](../../build.gradle).
