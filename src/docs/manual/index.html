<p>
<a href="https://github.com/abb-iss/Randoop.NET">Randoop.NET</a> is a version of Randoop that works with Microsoft's .NET platform, such as the C# programming language.
</p>

<p>
There is a separate <a href="dev.html">Randoop Developer's Manual</a>.
</p>


<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p> Writing tests is a difficult and time-consuming activity, and yet
it is a crucial part of good software engineering. Randoop
automatically generates unit tests for Java classes.
Randoop has had many
successful applications, especially with library classes (such as
java.util). Randoop is used at companies like ABB and Microsoft, and
on open-source
projects.
</p>

<p>
Here
is a <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/" rel="nofollow">JUnit</a> test case
generated by Randoop that reveals an error in OpenJDK (comments
added by hand): </p>

<pre class="code">

  // This test shows that the JDK collection classes
  // can create an object that is not equal to itself.
  @Test
  public static void test1() {

    LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
    Object o1 = new Object();
    list.addFirst(o1);

    // A TreeSet is an ordered collection. According to the API
    // documentation, this constructor call should throw a
    // ClassCastException because the list element is not Comparable. But
    // the constructor silently (and problematically) accepts the list.
    TreeSet t1 = new TreeSet(list);

    Set s1 = Collections.synchronizedSet(t1);

    // At this point, we have successfully created a set (s1)
    // that violations reflexivity of equality: it is not equal
    // to itself! This assertion fails at run time on OpenJDK.
    org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(s1.equals(s1));
  }
</pre>

<p>
  Randoop outputs two kinds of tests:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>error-revealing tests</b> that detect bugs in your current code, and
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>regression tests</b> that can be used to detect future bugs.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
You should fix the errors
revealed by the error-revealing tests suite then rerun Randoop, until it
generates no more error-revealing tests.  Then, you can run the regression
tests whenever you
change your source code, to be notified of any changes you make to the
behavior of your program.  You can always re-run Randoop to check for new
errors, to produce tests for newly-written code, or to regenerate tests
after a code change that causes desirable behavior-changes.
</p>

<p>
Randoop's tests are not designed to be short or easy to read &mdash;
but you will only read them on the rare
occasions when they fail and reveal a bug or a regression failure.

<h1 id="running_randoop">Running Randoop</h1>

<p>
Run Randoop by invoking its main class <code>randoop.main.Main</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
java randoop.main.Main <em>command</em> <em>args...</em>
</pre>

<p>
Randoop supports three commands:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>help</b> prints out a usage message.
For details, see <a href="#getting_help">Getting Help</a>.
Example uses:

<pre class="code">
java -classpath $(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main help
java -classpath $(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main help gentests
java -classpath $(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main help minimize
</pre>
</li>

<li> <b>gentests</b> generates unit tests. For details,
see <a href="#generating_tests">Generating Tests</a>. Example use:

<pre class="code">
java -Xmx3000m -classpath <em>myclasspath</em>:$(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main gentests --testclass=java.util.TreeSet --time-limit=60
</pre>
</li>

<li> <b>minimize</b> minimizes a failing JUnit test suite. For details,
see <a href="#minimize">Minimizing a failing JUnit test suite</a>.
Example use:

<pre class="code">
java -cp $(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main minimize --suitepath=ErrorTest0.java --suiteclasspath=<em>myclasspath</em>
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
(On Windows, adjust the classpath, such as using semicolon instead of colon
as the separator.)
You don't need the <code>-classpath</code> argument if you add
<code>$(RANDOOP_JAR)</code> to your classpath.
</p>



<h1 id="generating_tests">Generating tests</h1>

<p>By default, Randoop generates and then outputs two kinds of unit
  tests, written to separate files.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#error_revealing_tests"><em>Error-revealing tests</em></a>
    are tests that fail when executed,
    indicating a potential error in one or more classes under test.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#regression_tests"><em>Regression tests</em></a>
    are tests that pass when executed, and
    can be used to augment a regression test suite.
  </li>
</ul>
Other generated tests, classified as <em>invalid</em>, are discarded.

<p>
This section of the manual gives an
<a href="#example_collections">example</a> of how to run Randoop, then
describes
<a href="#classifying_tests">test classification</a>,
<a href="#error_revealing_tests">error-revealing tests</a>, and
<a href="#regression_tests">regression tests</a>,
and finally lists Randoop's <a href="#command-line-options">command-line options</a>. </p>


<h2 id="example_collections">Example: Generating tests for <code>java.util.Collections</code></h2>

<p>Imagine we want to generate tests for the
class <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html"><code>java.util.Collections</code></a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Randoop's tests only use
    classes you <a href="#specifying-methods">specify</a>.</strong> In order
to effectively test Collections, you should probably also specify some
helper classes, including classes that generate collections. For this
example, we will add <code>java.util.TreeSet</code> to the mix. </p>

<p>Create a file <code>myclasses.txt</code> that lists the names of the classes under test:
</p>
<pre class="code">java.util.Collections
java.util.TreeSet</pre>
<p>
and invoke Randoop as follows: </p>

<pre class="code">java -classpath $(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main gentests --classlist=myclasses.txt --time-limit=60</pre>


<p>After 60 seconds, Randoop stops generating tests. The last thing Randoop prints out is the name of the JUnit files containing the tests it generated. You should see a message similar to the following: </p>

<pre class="code">Created file: my/home/directory/RegressionTest0.java
Created file: my/home/directory/RegressionTest.java
Created file: my/home/directory/ErrorTest0.java
Created file: my/home/directory/ErrorTest.java
done.</pre>
<p>
Randoop creates two different main test suites, in classes
<code>ErrorTest</code> and <code>RegressionTest</code>. Compile and run the tests.
(The classpath should include the code under test, the generated tests, and
JUnit files <code>junit.jar</code> and <code>hamcrest-core.jar</code>.
Classes in <code>java.util.*</code> are always on the Java classpath, so they
are not needed in this particular example, but are shown because you will
usually need to supply them.)
</p>

<pre class="code">export JUNITPATH=.../junit.jar:.../hamcrest-core.jar
javac -classpath .:$JUNITPATH ErrorTest*.java RegressionTest*.java -sourcepath .:<em>path/to/files/under/test/</em>
java -classpath .:$JUNITPATH:<em>myclasspath</em> org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ErrorTest
java -classpath .:$JUNITPATH:<em>myclasspath</em> org.junit.runner.JUnitCore RegressionTest</pre>

<p>
All of the tests in ErrorTest will fail, and all of the tests in
RegressionTest will pass.
</p>

<p>
  You also might want to minimize the error-revealing tests before running them:
</p>

<pre class="code">
java -cp .:junit.jar:<em>myclasspath</em>:.../randoop/build/libs/randoop-all-4.0.0.jar \
  randoop.main.Main minimize --suitepath=ErrorTest0.java --suiteclasspath=.:junit-4.11.jar:<em>myclasspath</em>
</pre>


<h2 id="specifying-methods">Specifying methods, constructors, and fields that may appear in a test</h2>

<p>
Randoop only invokes a method or constructor <i>M</i> if <b>all</b> of the following are true:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <i>M</i> is declared in a class that is named
       by <a href="#option:testclass"><code>--testclass</code></a> or
       <a href="#option:classlist"><code>--classlist</code></a>, or is a
       member named by <a href="#option:methodlist"><code>--methodlist</code></a>.
  </li>
  <li> <i>M</i> does not match any of the patterns given
       via <a href="#option:omitmethods"><code>--omitmethods</code></a>.
       or <a href="#option:omitmethods_list"><code>--omitmethods-list</code></a>.
       </li>
  <li> All of the following are accessible from the package of the tests
       (set with <a href="#option:junit-package-name"><code>--junit-package-name</code></a>):
       <i>M</i>'s class, <i>M</i>, and <i>M</i>'s
    return type and parameter types.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
A method or constructor <i>M</i> that satisfies the above conditions is called
a "<b>method under test</b>".
Randoop only calls methods under test; that is, these are the only
methods that will appear in a test case.
</p>

<p>
The methods under test must include not only the methods whose results you
wish to appear in an <code>assert</code> statement, but also methods that a
test may need to call in order to set up state or create argument values.
All of those methods are also being implicitly tested by the
<code>assert</code> statement.
</p>

<p>
  Use raw type names such as <code>List</code>, not parameterized types such
  as <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, when specifying classes or methods.
</p>

<p>
  Do not include methods that side-effect global state.
  (Methods that side-effect the state of their receiver or other arguments are fine.)
  The reason is that such methods create dependent tests that cannot be run
  in isolation or reordered.
  For example, if test A side-effects global state and test B reads global
  state, then whether test B fails depends on whether test A is run before
  test B.
</p>

<p><b><i>WARNING: If you ask Randoop to test code that modifies your file
system (such as <a  href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html#delete--">File.delete()</a>),
then Randoop will generate tests that modify your file system!
Be careful when choosing
classes and methods to test.</i></b>
</p>

<h2 id="classifying_tests">Classifying tests</h2>

<p>
Randoop generates many tests internally, and it classifies each generated test as
error-revealing, expected behavior, or invalid.  The classification depends
primarily on whether the last statement throws an exception or
<a href="#kinds_of_errors">violates a contract</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can use command-line arguments to customize Randoop's rules for classifying tests.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked exceptions:  By default, Randoop classifies a test that throws
  a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-11.html#jls-11.1.1">checked exception</a> as expected behavior.  You can override this default
  with the <a href="#option:checked-exception"><code>--checked-exception</code></a>
  command-line option; specify
  <code>--checked-exception=error</code>,
  <code>--checked-exception=expected</code>, or
  <code>--checked-exception=invalid</code>.
</li>
<li><code>OutOfMemoryError</code> or <code>StackOverflowError</code>. Options:
<a href="#option:oom-exception"><code>--oom-exception</code></a>
and <a href="#option:sof-exception"><code>--sof-exception</code></a>;
default invalid</li>
<li><code>NullPointerException</code> when <code>null</code> is passed as
  an argument to any method in the test.
Option: <a href="#option:npe-on-null-input"><code>--npe-on-null-input</code></a>; default expected
</li>
<li><code>NullPointerException</code> when only non-<code>null</code>
  values are provided as an argument.
Option: <a href="#option:npe-on-non-null-input"><code>--npe-on-non-null-input</code></a>; default invalid</li>
<li>Unchecked exceptions other than <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> and <code>NullPointerException</code>. Option:
<a href="#option:unchecked-exception"><code>--unchecked-exception</code></a>; default expected</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional ERROR behaviors are described in the
<a href="#error_revealing_tests">error-revealing tests</a> section.
</p>

<p>
The default behavior for
<a href="#option:unchecked-exception"><code>--unchecked-exception</code></a> is to
treat throwing any unchecked exception as expected, normal behavior.  An
alternative would be to consider a test that throws
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AssertionError.html">AssertionError</a>
as error-revealing.  However, a random test generator often supplies illegal
arguments (such as <code>null</code> to a method that requires a non-null
argument), and this approach will lead to false alarms in which Randoop
outputs an "error-revealing test" that misuses the software under test.
Depending on your needs, you can override Randoop's default.
</p>

<p>
A thrown exception is <em>not</em> considered a contract violation unless the
exception is
tagged as error behavior. This is because a method may have a precondition that
is unknown to Randoop.
For example, a binary search implementation might
require that its input is sorted.  Randoop should not mark the method
as buggy just because it throws an exception when Randoop passes it an
ill-formed unsorted array.  Randoop has no way of knowing each method's
precondition, so by default it assumes that any exception thrown by a
method is correct behavior in response to the values that it was passed.
You can customize how exceptions are considered by
<a href="#classifying_tests">assigning the exception behavior type</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can also provide specifications of your code to further help
Randoop classify tests; see the <a href="#checkrep">checkRep
mechanism</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="error_revealing_tests">Error-revealing tests</h2>

<p>
When Randoop includes a error-revealing test in file <code>ErrorTest.java</code>,
the test shows that the code
violates its specification or contract &mdash; some property that it is supposed to preserve.  For example, the test shown in
the <a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
creates a <code>TreeSet</code> that
violates <i>reflexivity of equality</i>:  namely, for every
object <code>o</code>, <code>o.equals(o)</code> should
return <code>true</code>.
The test reveals an error in the <code>TreeSet</code> constructor, which does
not properly check its arguments (and possibly a second error in the
<code>TreeSet.equals</code> method, which should always check if its argument
is the same object as itself and return <code>true</code> in such a case).
</p>

<p>
The test in the <a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> is nicely
succinct: it shows a small number of method calls leading up to the
assertion violation. Because Randoop's generation is random, the actual
test revealing the error can be significantly longer, and contain many
irrelevant calls that are not necessary to reveal the contract violation.
You may wish to <a href="#minimize_failing_test_suite">minimize the test
case</a> to ease debugging.
</p>


<h3 id="kinds_of_errors">What kinds of errors does Randoop check for?</h3>  <!-- omit from toc -->

<p>
  When Randoop calls a method that creates an object, Randoop verifies that
  the object is well-formed.
  Currently, Randoop checks for the following contracts: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Contracts over <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals-java.lang.Object-">Object.equals()</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Reflexivity:</i> <code>o.equals(o)</code> == <code>true</code> </li>
      <li><i>Symmetry:</i> <code>o1.equals(o2)</code> == <code>o2.equals(o1)</code> </li>
	<li><i>Transitivity:</i> <code>o1.equals(o2)</code> && <code>o2.equals(o3)</code> &rArr; <code>o1.equals(o3)</code> </li>
      <li><i>Equals to null:</i> <code>o.equals(null)</code> == <code>false</code> </li>
      <li>it does not throw an exception</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contracts over <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode--">Object.hashCode()</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Equals and hashcode are consistent:</i> If <code>o1.equals(o2)==true</code>, then <code>o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()</code> </li>
      <li>it does not throw an exception</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contracts over <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#clone--">Object.clone()</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>it does not throw an exception, including <code>CloneNotSupportedException</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contracts over <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString--">Object.toString()</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>it does not throw an exception</li>
      <li>it does not return null</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contracts over <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">Comparable.compareTo()</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare-T-T-">Comparator.compare()</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Reflexivity:</i> <code>o.compareTo(o)</code> == 0  (implied by anti-symmetry)</li>
      <li><i>Anti-symmetry:</i> <code>sgn(o1.compareTo(o2))</code> == <code>-sgn(o2.compareTo(o1))</code> </li>
	<li><i>Transitivity:</i> <code>o1.compareTo(o2)>0</code> && <code>o2.compareTo(o3)>0</code> &rArr; <code>o1.compareTo(o3)>0</code> </li>
      <li><i>Substitutability of equals:</i> <code>x.compareTo(y)==0</code> &rArr; <code>sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z))</code></li>
      <li><i>Consistency with <code>equals()</code>:</i> <code>(x.compareTo(y)==0) == x.equals(y)</code> (this contract can be disabled)</li>
      <li>it does not throw an exception</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contracts over <code>checkRep()</code> (that is, any nullary method annotated with <a href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/api/randoop/CheckRep.html"><code>@CheckRep</code></a>):
    <ul>
      <li>if its return type is <code>boolean</code>, it returns <code>true</code></li>
      <li>it does not throw an exception</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Violation of any of these contracts is highly likely to indicate an error.
</p>

<p>
You can add additional contracts to Randoop.
</p>


<h2 id="regression_tests">Regression tests</h2>

<p>
The tests in the <code>RegressionTest*.java</code> files record the current behavior
(values returned or exceptions thrown) of the classes under test.  These
tests assert that behavior, and they currently pass.  After you change your
code, you can run these regression tests, which will alert you if your
code changes affect the external behavior of the classes.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of a regression test for
the TreeSet class: </p>

<pre class="code">// This test passes when executed
@Test
public void test10() throws Throwable {

  java.util.TreeSet var0 = new java.util.TreeSet();
  java.lang.Short var1 = new java.lang.Short((short)100);
  boolean var2 = var0.contains(var1);

  // Regression assertion (captures the current behavior of the code)
  org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(var2 == false);
}</pre>

<p>This test would fail if you introduced an error that caused <code>contains</code> to return true on an empty set. </p>

<p>
A regression test can also assert what exception is currently thrown,
and it will fail if the code is changed to no longer throw that exception.
</p>


<h3 id="regression_test_failures">Regression test failures</h3>

<p>
If a regression test fails even though you have not changed your program,
then the test is <a href="#flaky-tests">flaky</a>.
</p>

<p>
If a regression test fails after you change your program, there are three
possible causes.  You need to debug the test failure to determine which is
the cause, and then take the appropriate action.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You have introduced an error &mdash; your code changes are incorrect.<br />
    In this case, you should correct your mistake and re-run the test suite.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have intentionally changed the visible behavior of your program.  The
    regression test has corroborated the change.<br />
    In this case, you need to update the tests.  Alternately, you can just
    discard them and generate new ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    The tests are too sensitive, and they have failed even though you made
    an inconsequential change.  For example, maybe
    the tests depend on the order of elements in a hash
    table.<br />
    In this case, you need to re-run
    Randoop, <a href="#nondeterminism-in-program-under-test">informing it
    not to depend on observations that may vary from run to run</a>.
    You can also see the techniques suggested in the paper
    <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/maintainable-tests-ase2011.pdf">Scaling
    Up Automated Test Generation</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Usually, a change to your program causes many test failures, not just one.
This is because Randoop generates many tests for each part of your
program's functionality.  Don't panic!  In most cases, all of the failures
have the same cause.
</p>

<p>
You may wish to verify the cause of the failures.  A way to do this is to
change the part of the program, that you suspect is the cause, back to its
previous behavior.  Once you are satisfied that you understand the
failures, you can discard the tests and have Randoop generate new ones.
For example, suppose that you believe that all the test failures are caused
by a change to method <code>m</code>.  You can change <code>m</code> back to its
previous implementation and run the tests.  If they all succeed, you can
change <code>m</code> back to its new implementation and re-generate the tests.
(As an alternative to making a temporary change to your source code, you
can use
the <a href="#replacecall"><code>replacecall</code> feature of the Randoop
agent</a> to replace the new functionality by the old functionality.)
</p>


<h2 id="generation_stages">Stages of test generation, and limiting test generation</h2>

<p>
Here is how Randoop attempts to generate a test:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Randoop selects a method to call.  (This is called a "step".)  The
    selected method will be the last method call in the test.  If Randoop is
    unable to find arguments to the method call (that are different from calls
    to the method in other tests), then Randoop starts over.  Otherwise, Randoop
    has created a test candidate -- a new, unique sequence of operations that
    ends with the selected method.
  </li>
  <li>
    Randoop executes the test candidate
    and <a href="#classifying_tests">classifies</a> its behavior.  If its
    behavior is invalid, then Randoop discards it and starts over.
  </li>
  <li>
    Randoop outputs error-revealing and regression tests, in separate suites.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The user can provide limits on any part of the test generation process, or on
  Randoop's run time.  Test generation stops when any of the following occurs
  (this is controlled by method <code>AbstractGenerator.shouldStop</code>):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The time limit (<a href="#option:time-limit"><code>--time-limit</code></a>)
    is reached, or
  </li>
  <li>
    the number of attempts to generate a sequence reaches the step limit
    (<a href="#option:attemtedLimit"><code>--attemptedLimit</code></a>), or
  </li>
  <li>
    the number of generated sequences reaches the input limit
    (<a href="#option:generatedLimit"><code>--generatedLimit</code></a>), or
  </li>
  <li>
    the number of error-revealing and regression tests reaches the output
    limit (<a href="#option:outputLimit"><code>--outputLimit</code></a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    one error-revealing test is generated, and
    <a href="#option:stop-on-error-test"><code>--stop-on-error-test=true</code></a>
    was supplied.
  </li>
  <li>
    a custom <code>Stopper</code> was provided and it indicates that
    generation should stop (see the Randoop code).
  </li>
  <li>
    a <code>RandoopListenerManager</code>'s <code>IEventListener</code> it
    indicates that generation should stop (see the Randoop code).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore, see the <a href="#optiongroup:Threading">command-line options
for threading</a> for additional per-test time limits.
</p>


<h2 id="minimize">Minimizing a failing JUnit test suite</h2>

<p>
Randoop includes a minimizer that, given a failing JUnit test suite file,
produces a smaller one that fails in the same way as the original, having the
same failing assertions with the same stack trace. Minimized test suites usually
contain test cases that are easier to understand and debug.
The minimizer can be used with any JUnit test suite:  it can
minimize failing tests that Randoop did not create.
</p>

<p>
The minimizer works by removing and simplifying methods and statements in its
input file, without changing the test suite's failure behavior.
</p>

<p>
To minimize all failing tests in <code>ErrorTest1.java</code>, run
Randoop as follows:
</p>
<pre class="code">
java -cp randoop-all-4.0.0.jar randoop.main.Main minimize \
  --suitepath=ErrorTest0.java --suiteclasspath=junit.jar:commons-lang.jar --testsuitetimeout=30
</pre>

<p>
In the example above, the output file produced by the minimizer would be named
<code>ErrorTest1Minimized.java</code> and the main class would be named
<code>ErrorTest1Minimized</code>. In general, the minimizer will produce a Java file
named <code><em>InputTestSuite</em>Minimized.java</code> where
<code><em>InputTestSuite</em>.java</code> is the name of the file being minimized. The main
class within the Java file will be named <code>InputTestSuiteMinimized</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is desirable for the minimizer to retain both the original error-revealing test suite and
the minimized test suite. This is because the minimizer may simplify a test suite in such a
way that important information is lost. For example, when a test case fails due to a
<code>NullPointerException</code>, the minimizer can replace the right hand side of an
expression with the value <code>null</code>. This is sometimes an oversimplification.

</p>

<p>
  See the documentation for the
  <a href="#optiongroup:Test-case-minimization-options">command-line options for failing test suite minimization</a>.
</p>


<h1 id="customize">Customizing Randoop's behavior to your application</h1>

<p>
If you run Randoop without any command-line arguments or customizations to
your environment, it will produce helpful tests.  However, Randoop will
produce much more helpful tests if you spend a little bit of time to tell
Randoop about your application, and that is how we recommend using Randoop.

 in addition to any specified using <code>--classlist</code>, and must be accessible from the package
 of the tests (set with <code>--junit-package-name</code>).
            <li id="option:classlist"><b>--classlist=</b><i>filename</i>.
             File that lists classes to test. All of their methods are methods under test.

 <p>In the file, each class under test is specified by its fully-qualified name on a separate
 line. See an <a href= "https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/class_list_example.txt">

 All classes must be accessible from the package of the tests (set with <code>--junit-package-name</code>).
            <li id="option:methodlist"><b>--methodlist=</b><i>filename</i>.
             A file containing a list of methods and constructors to test, each given as a <a

 <p>These methods augment any methods from classes given by the <code>--testclass</code> or <code>--classlist</code> options.

 file</a>.
            <li id="option:omitmethods"><b>--omitmethods=</b><i>regex</i> <code>[+]</code>.
             A regex that indicates methods that should not be called directly in generated tests. This does
 not prevent indirect calls to such methods from other, allowed methods.

 <p>Randoop will not directly call a method whose <a
 href="#fully-qualified-signature">fully-qualified signature</a> matches the regular expression,
 or a method inherited from a superclass or interface whose signature matches the regular
 expression.

 <p>If the regular expression contains anchors "<code>^</code>" and "<code>$</code>", they refer to the
 beginning and the end of the signature string.
            <li id="option:omitmethods-file"><b>--omitmethods-file=</b><i>filename</i>.
             A file containing a list of regular expressions that indicate methods that should not be
 included in generated tests. These patterns are used along with those provided with <code>--omitmethods</code>, and the default omissions.
            <li id="option:dont-omit-replaced-methods"><b>--dont-omit-replaced-methods=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Include methods that are otherwise omitted by default. Unless you set this to true, every
 method replaced by the <code>replacecall</code> agent is treated as if it had been supplied as an
 argument to <code>--omitmethods</code>. [default false]
            <li id="option:omit-field"><b>--omit-field=</b><i>string</i> <code>[+]</code>.
             A fully-qualified field name of a field to be excluded from test generation. An accessible
 field is used unless it is omitted by this or the <code>--omit-field-list</code> option.
            <li id="option:omit-field-list"><b>--omit-field-list=</b><i>filename</i>.
             File that contains fully-qualified field names to be excluded from test generation. An
 accessible field is used unless it is omitted by this or the <code>--omit-field</code> option.
            <li id="option:only-test-public-members"><b>--only-test-public-members=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Restrict tests to only include public members of classes. Ordinarily, the setting of <code>--junit-package-name</code> and package accessibility is used to determine which members will be used
 in tests. Using this option restricts the tests to only use public members even if the class is
 a member of the same package as the generated tests. [default false]
            <li id="option:silently-ignore-bad-class-names"><b>--silently-ignore-bad-class-names=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Ignore class names specified by user that cannot be found [default false]
            <li id="option:flaky-test-behavior"><b>--flaky-test-behavior=</b><i>enum</i>.
             What to do if Randoop generates a flaky test. A flaky test is one that behaves differently on
 different executions.

 <p>Setting this option to <code>DISCARD</code> or <code>OUTPUT</code> should be considered a last resort.
 Flaky tests are usually due to calling Randoop on side-effecting or nondeterministic methods,
 and a better solution is not to call Randoop on such methods; see the discussion of
 nondeterminism in the Randoop manual. [default HALT]
<ul>
  <li><b>HALT</b> Randoop halts with a diagnostic message.
  <li><b>DISCARD</b> Discard the flaky test. If Randoop produces any flaky tests, this option might slow Randoop
 down by a factor of 2 or more.
  <li><b>OUTPUT</b> Output the flaky test; the resulting test suite may fail when it is run.

      <ul>
            <li id="option:no-error-revealing-tests"><b>--no-error-revealing-tests=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Whether to output error-revealing tests. Disables all output when used with <code>--no-regression-tests</code>. Restricting output can result in long runs if the default values of
 <code>--generated-limit</code> and <code>--time-limit</code> are used. [default false]
            <li id="option:no-regression-tests"><b>--no-regression-tests=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Whether to output regression tests. Disables all output when used with <code>--no-error-revealing-tests</code>. Restricting output can result in long runs if the default values
 of <code>--generated-limit</code> and <code>--time-limit</code> are used. [default false]
            <li id="option:no-regression-assertions"><b>--no-regression-assertions=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Whether to include assertions in regression tests. If false, then the regression tests contain
 no assertions (except that if the test throws an exception, it should continue to throw an
 exception of the same type). Tests without assertions can be used to exercise the code, but
 they do not enforce any particular behavior, such as values returned. [default false]
            <li id="option:check-compilable"><b>--check-compilable=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Whether to check that generated sequences can be compiled. If true, the code for each generated
 sequence is compiled, and the sequence is only kept if the compilation succeeds without error.
 This check is useful because the assumptions in Randoop generation heuristics are sometimes
 violated by input methods, and, as a result, a generated test may not compile. This check does
 increases the runtime by approximately 50%. [default true]
            <li id="option:require-classname-in-test"><b>--require-classname-in-test=</b><i>regex</i>.
             Classes that must occur in a test. Randoop will only output tests whose source code has at
 least one use of a member of a class whose name matches the regular expression.
            <li id="option:require-covered-classes"><b>--require-covered-classes=</b><i>filename</i>.
             File containing fully-qualified names of classes that the tests must use. This option only
 works if Randoop is run using the <a
 href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/index.html#covered-filter">covered-class
 javaagent</a> to instrument the classes. A test is output only if it uses at least one of the
 class names in the file. A test uses a class if it invokes any constructor or method of the
 class, directly or indirectly (the constructor or method might not appear in the source code of
 the test). Included classes may be abstract.
            <li id="option:minimize-error-test"><b>--minimize-error-test=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Flag indicating whether or not to automatically minimize error-revealing tests. Both original
 and minimized versions of each test class will be output. Setting this option may cause long
 Randoop run times if Randoop outputs and minimizes more than about 100 error-revealing tests. [default false]

 <p>If true, Randoop will not generate a test when unable to find a non-null value of
 appropriate type as an input. This could result in certain class members being untested. [default false]
            <li id="option:literals-file"><b>--literals-file=</b><i>string</i> <code>[+]</code>.
             A file containing literal values to be used as inputs to methods under test, or "CLASSES".

 <p>Literals in these files are used in addition to all other constants in the pool. For the
 format of this file, see documentation in class <code>randoop.reflection.LiteralFileReader</code>.
 The special value "CLASSES" (with no quotes) means to read literals from all classes under
 test.
            <li id="option:literals-level"><b>--literals-level=</b><i>enum</i>.
             How to use literal values that are specified via the <code>--literals-file</code> command-line
 option. See: <code>ClassLiteralsMode</code>. [default CLASS]
<ul>
  <li><b>NONE</b> Do not use literals specified in a literals file.
  <li><b>CLASS</b> A literal for a given class is used as input only to methods of that class.
  <li><b>PACKAGE</b> A literal is used as input to methods of any classes in the same package.
  <li><b>ALL</b> Each literal is used as input to any method under test.
</ul>

            <li id="option:string-maxlen"><b>--string-maxlen=</b><i>int</i>.
             Maximum length of strings in generated tests, including in assertions. Strings longer than 65KB
 (or about 10,000 characters) may be rejected by the Java compiler, according to the Java
 Virtual Machine specification. [default 10000]

             Try to reuse values from a sequence with the given frequency. If an alias ratio is given, it
 should be between 0 and 1.

 <p>A ratio of 0 results in tests where each value created within a test input is typically used
 at most once as an argument in a method call. A ratio of 1 tries to maximize the number of
 times values are used as inputs to parameters within a test. [default 0.0]
            <li id="option:small-tests"><b>--small-tests=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Favor shorter sequences when assembling new sequences out of old ones.

 <p>Randoop generates new tests by combining old previously-generated tests. If this option is
 given, tests with fewer calls are given greater weight during its random selection. This has
 the overall effect of producing smaller JUnit tests. [default false]
            <li id="option:clear"><b>--clear=</b><i>int</i>.
             Clear the component set each time it contains the given number of inputs.

 <p>Randoop stores previously-generated tests in a "component" set, and uses them to generate
 new tests. Setting this variable to a small number can sometimes result in a greater variety of
 tests generated during a single run. [default 100000000]

             Name of the package for the generated JUnit files. When the package is the same as the package
 of a class under test, then package visibility rules are used to determine whether to include
 the class or class members in a test. Tests can be restricted to public members only by using
 the option <code>--only-test-public-members</code>.

             Run test generation without output. May be desirable when running with a visitor.

 <p>NOTE: Because there is no output, the value of <code>--output-limit</code> will never be met, so
 be sure to set <code>--generated-limit</code> or <code>--time-limit</code> to a reasonable value when

            <li id="option:junit-reflection-allowed"><b>--junit-reflection-allowed=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             Whether to use JUnit's standard reflective mechanisms for invoking tests. JUnit's reflective
 invocations can interfere with code instrumentation, such as by the DynComp tool. If that is a
 problem, then set this to false and Randoop will output tests that use direct method calls

            <li id="option:deterministic"><b>--deterministic=</b><i>boolean</i>.
             If true, Randoop is deterministic: running Randoop twice with the same arguments (including
 <code>--randomseed</code>) will produce the same test suite, so long as the program under test is
 deterministic. If false, Randoop may or may not produce the same test suite. To produce

 are not reported to the user, but are recorded in Randoop's log. Use the <code>--log</code>
 command-line option to make Randoop produce the log.

 <p>Use this option if Randoop does not terminate, which is usually due to execution of code

</ul>

<p>
where <code>package-name</code> is a period-separated list of identifiers,
and <code>argument-list</code> is a comma-separated list of fully-qualified
Java raw types, without spaces.
</p>


<h2 id="replacecall">Avoiding calls to specific methods</h2>

<p>
The code under test can make calls to methods that you do not want executed.
One is <code>System.exit</code>, which will terminate Randoop if called during test generation.
Others, such as the <code>JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog</code> methods, open a modal dialog box requiring user interaction, which interferes with automated testing.
It is not enough to use <a href="#option:omitmethods"><code>--omitmethods</code></a> to
prevent direct calls to these methods, because the methods may still be called indirectly.
To prevent all calls to these methods, use the <code>replacecall</code> agent.
</p>

<p>
The Randoop <code>replacecall</code> agent transforms the code under test, replacing
each call to an undesired method by a call to some other method.
To use it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>When running Randoop, pass the following command-line options to <code>java</code>:
<pre>
-Xbootclasspath/a:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar -javaagent:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>When running the generated tests, add the file <code>replacecall-4.0.0.jar</code> to the boot class path,
    and pass the same command-line options to <code>java</code>:
<pre>
-Xbootclasspath/a:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar -javaagent:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
By default, the agent makes the following replacements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A call to <code>System.exit()</code> is replaced by a call to a method that
    throws a Randoop-specific exception that Randoop includes in the generated tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    A call to certain methods of AWT and Swing classes is replaced by a call to
    an implementation that is designed to avoid hanging both during test generation
    by Randoop and during execution of the generated tests.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, Randoop treats replaced methods as if the methods were given as arguments
to <a href="#option:omitmethods"><code>--omitmethods</code></a>.
This prevents Randoop from creating tests with direct calls to them.
</p>



<h3 id="replacecall-load-exclusions">Replacement exclusions</h3>

<p>
There are some classes to which the replacecall agent should not be applied.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the agent in a build environment such as Ant, Maven, or
Gradle, it is necessary to exclude the build environment classes.
For instance, when running the agent on generated tests in a Gradle project using the Java plugin, the replacement of <code>System.exit</code>
will affect the behavior of the build, and we should exclude the Gradle packages from being transformed.
To exclude these packages, place the package names in an exclusion file <code>gradle-exclusions.txt</code>
</p>
<pre>
org.gradle.
worker.org.gradle.
</pre>
<p>
and run the agent with the <code>--dont-transform</code> command-line option
and the filename as its argument:
</p>
<pre>
-javaagent:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar=--dont-transform=gradle-exclusions.txt
</pre>

<p>
The exclusion file is a list of package names &mdash; one package per line.
(Blank lines and <code>//</code>-style comments are ignored.)
If a package name does not end with a period, one will be added.
The package name is used to match the prefix of the fully-qualified classname.
</p>

<p>
For a different environment, you can determine what classes are being affected by running the agent with the
  <code>--debug</code> flag
</p>
<pre>
-javaagent:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar=--debug
</pre>
<p>
and looking in the file <code>transform-log.txt</code> to see which methods are being transformed.
</p>

<p>
By default, the agent does not modify Randoop, the agent itself, or
JUnit classes.
So, by default, the agent will not make replacements in Randoop and Randoop
Java agent classes, classes in certain subpackages of <code>com.sun.tools</code> and <code>com.sun.source</code>, or in JUnit or Hamcrest classes.
Also, to improve performance, the agent does not make replacements in boot-loaded classes
with the exception of packages in <code>java.awt</code> and <code>javax.swing</code>.
</p>



<h3 id="replacecall-replacement-definition">Defining replacements</h3>

<p>
To define your own method replacements, you will write mock implementations (<a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/blob/master/agent/replacecall/src/main/java/randoop/mock/java/awt/Component.java">example</a>)
and you will specify the replacements in a replacement file (<a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/blob/master/agent/replacecall/src/main/resources/default-replacements.txt">example</a>).
</p>

<p>
Give the replacement file to the replacecall agent using the <code>--replacement-file</code> argument:
</p>
<pre>
-javaagent:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/replacecall-4.0.0.jar=--replacement-file=replacement-file.txt
</pre>

<p>
A replacement method must be static and non-private.
If the original method is static, the replacement method should have the
identical signature.
If the original method is non-static, then the replacement method should 
have an additional first parameter whose type should be the containing
class of the original method.
For instance, a call to <code>java.awt.Component.show()</code> would be replaced
by a call to a method with the signature <code>show(java.awt.Component)</code>.
An example mock class is 
<a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/blob/master/agent/replacecall/src/main/java/randoop/mock/java/awt/Component.java"><code>randoop.mock.java.awt.Component</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
To simplify your replacement file and keep your mock classes organized, it
is recommended that you choose a package prefix and keep the package
structure of the original classes.
The example file uses <code>randoop.mock</code> as the prefix, so the fully-qualified
name of the <code>JOptionPane</code> mock class is <code>randoop.mock.javax.swing.JOptionPane</code>.
(You may need to <a href="replacecall-load-exclusions">exclude</a> this package if any of the replacement methods use otherwise replaced methods.)
</p>

<p>
Randoop comes with default replacements, which are in sub-packages
of <code>randoop.mock</code>.  You should not use
the <code>randoop.mock</code> prefix for your own mock classes.
</p>

<p>
Keep the following in mind when defining replacements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Only methods may be replaced. <!-- TODO: does this mean not constructors? -->
  </li>
  <li>
    If you define a replacement for a method that returns a value,
    it can change the behavior of client code.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4 id="replacecall-replacement-implementation">Implementing replacement classes</h4>

<p>
Sometimes, a replacement for an instance method needs to use a different
object than the receiver (it might have the same or a different type than
the receiver).  In this case, your replacement class should maintain a map
from instances of the original receiver to instances that will be used in
the replacement.  An example appears in {@code
randoop.mock.java.util.MockRandom}.
</p>


<h2 id="specifying-behavior">Specifying expected code behavior (pre- and post-conditions)</h2>

<p>
You can provide a specification of the expected behavior of code.  Randoop will
use the specification to better classify method calls as error-revealing,
expected behavior, or invalid.
</p>

<p>
You can specify both <a href="#method-specifications">the behavior of
methods and constructors</a>,
and <a href="#representation-invariants">representation invariants for
classes</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="spec-json-method-specifications">Method specifications</h3>

<p>
A specification of a method (including constructors) indicates the
circumstances when the method can be called, and how it should behave when
called.
</p>

<p>
The <code>--specifications=file</code> command-line option names a file
containing the method specifications.  The file format is a JSON list with
elements that are the serialized form of
the <a href="../api/randoop/condition/specification/OperationSpecification.html">OperationSpecification</a>
class.  Randoop comes with an <a href="net_connection_spec.json">example
specification file</a>, which provides specifications for an example
class <code><a href="net_connection_java.txt">net.Connection</a></code>.
</p>

<p>
A method specification consists of the method signature, parameter names, a
list of pre-conditions, a list of (normal) post-conditions, and a list of
throws-conditions (exceptional post-conditions):

<pre><code>
  {
    "operation": <i>method-signature</i>,
    "identifiers": <i>formal-parameters</i>,
    "pre-conditions": <i>pre-condition-list</i>,
    "post-conditions": <i>normal-post-condition-list</i>,
    "throws-conditions": <i>throws-condition-list</i>
  }
</code></pre>

<p>
where only the <code>operation</code> field is required.
</p>


<h4 id="spec-json-method-signatures">Method signatures</h4>

<p>
A method signature uniquely describes a method.  It consists of the
declaring class, method name, and parameter types.  Types are given in the
format used
by <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getName--"><code>Class.forName()</code></a>;
for example, member classes are set off with "<code>$</code>", as
in <code>pkg.Class$InnerClass</code>.
</p>

<p>
The method <code>net.Connection.send(int)</code>
is represented as
</p>

<pre><code>
  {
    "classname": "net.Connection",
    "name": "send",
    "parameterTypes": [ "int" ]
  }
</code></pre>


<h4 id="spec-json-parameter-names">Formal parameter names</h4>

<p>
The conditions in a specification use identifiers, or variable names, to
refer to formal parameters and the result.  This part of the specification
gives the names.
For example:
</p>

<pre><code>
  {
    "parameters": [ "coded" ],
    "receiverName": "target",
    "returnName": "returnValue"
  }
</code></pre>

<p>
indicates that the single formal parameter of the method is referred to by
the name <code>coded</code>.
The receiver name may be omitted (default: <code>receiver</code>),
and the return value name may be omitted (default: <code>result</code>).
</p>


<h4 id="spec-json-conditions">Specifying conditions</h4>

<p>
The specification contains 3 lists of conditions, one for each different
type of condition.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><i>Pre-condition</i></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  A <i>pre-condition</i> indicates a requirement that must be satisfied by
  the caller.  Its guard is a Boolean expression that is evaluated in the
  pre-state &mdash; that is, before a method starts to execute.  If the
  caller does not satisfy the pre-condition, then the call is invalid.
  </p>

  <p>
  To specify that the argument to a call to <code>net.Connection.send(int)</code>
  must be positive, you could write the condition
  </p>

  <pre><code>
    {
      "description": "the code must be positive",
      "guard": "coded &gt; 0"
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>
  The condition has an optional field <code>description</code>
  that Randoop uses in comments in the generated tests.
  </p>

  <p>
  To require that the <code>Connection</code> is open and the code is
  non-negative, you could equivalently write a single
  pre-condition <code>receiver.isOpen() &amp;&amp; code &gt; 0</code> or
  two pre-conditions <code>receiver.isOpen()</code> and <code>code &gt;
  0</code>.
  </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><i>(Normal) Post-condition</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A post-condition indicates a requirement that must be satisfied by the method
    implementation. A normal postcondition indicates what values the method
    returns. If the caller satisfies the method's pre-condition and the method
    returns normally (without throwing an exception), then the post-condition
    must be satisfied or else the method is buggy.
    </p>

    <p>
    You specify a normal post-condition as guard-property pair.  (A
    property is given using the same format as a guard, but a property is
    evaluated in the post-state &mdash; that is, after a method has
    finished executing.)  In the example file, the
    method <code>net.Connection.receive()</code> has the post-condition:
    </p>

  <pre><code>
    {
      "guard": "true",
      "property": "result &gt;= 0",
      "description": "returns non-negative received value"
    }

  <dt><i>Throws-condition</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A post-condition indicates requirements that must be satisfied by the method
    implementation. A throws-condition is a post-condition that indicates an
    exception the method is expected to throw. If a call satisfies the guard of
    a throws-condition, the exception must be thrown or the method is buggy.
    </p>

    <p>
    You specify a throws-condition as a guard-exception pair.
    If a guard is satisfied, then the method is supposed to throw an exception
    of the named class, or a subclass of the named class.
    From the example file, the <code>net.Connection.open()</code> method has
    the throws-condition
    </p>

    <pre><code>
      {
        "guard": "receiver.isOpen()",
        "exception": "java.lang.IllegalStateException",
        "description": "throws IllegalStateException if the connection is already open"
      }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    Similar to normal post-conditions, throws-conditions are given in a list.
    The list, however, is treated as a set (meaning unordered), and may contain
    duplicate guards and exceptions. A method whose behavior is specified as
    </p>

    <pre><code>
      [
        {
          "guard": "a == null",

          "description": "throws NullPointerException if a is null"
        },
        {
          "guard": "i &lt; 0",
          "exception": "java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException",

</dl>


<h4 id="method-specification-evaluation-rules">Evaluation rules</h4>

<p>
Randoop classifies a test sequence according to its last method call.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If the guard of any pre-condition is violated before the call, then Randoop
    classifies the method call as invalid and the sequence is discarded.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the guard of any throws-condition is satisfied before the call, the
    exception from the condition is added to a set <code>expected</code> of
    expected exceptions.  If the call throws a checked exception, the
    sequence is classified as having expected behavior if the thrown
    exception is a member of the set <code>expected</code>, or is a
    subclass of a member of <code>expected</code>, and is otherwise
    classified as error-revealing.  If the <code>expected</code> set is
    non-empty and the call terminates normally, the sequence is classified
    as error-revealing.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the guard of a normal-precondition is satisfied before the call, the
    property for the first satisfied guard is checked after the call.
    If the call terminates normally, the sequence is classified as having
    expected behavior if the property is satisfied.
    Otherwise, the sequence is classified as error-revealing.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the method is inherited, the method call is also checked against all
    specifications of overridden methods in the inheritance chain.
    If the call is invalid by any specification, the sequence is classified
    as invalid.
    If the call is error-revealing by any specification, the sequence is
    classified as error-revealing.
    Otherwise, all specifications are satisfied and the sequence has
    expected behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise, the sequence is classified according to the
    rules of <a href="#classifying-tests">classifying tests</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Randoop does no check of whether the guards are exhaustive or disjoint.
</p>

<p>
Randoop ships with specifications for parts of the JDK, and these
specifications are used by default, unless you disable command-line option
<a href="#option:use-jdk-specifications"><code>--use-jdk-specifications</code></a>.
</p>


<h3 id="checkrep">Specifying representation invariant methods (such as <code>checkRep</code>)</h3>

<p>
The "representation invariant" of a class is a property that all
instances of the class must satisfy.  For example, a field might
contain a non-negative number, or two fields might contain lists of
the same length.
Sometimes, a program contains a method that checks the rep invariant,
for debugging purposes.
If the rep invariant is ever violated, the program has a bug.
</p>

<p>
By using the
<a href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/api/randoop/CheckRep.html"><code>@CheckRep</code></a>
annotation, you can
tell Randoop which methods in your classes under test are rep
invariant methods.  Randoop will call these methods; if the method
ever fails, Randoop outputs the test as a failing test.
</p>

<p>
A method annotated with <code>@CheckRep</code> must have one of two
allowed signatures:
</p>

<ul>

<li>A public instance method with no arguments and return
type <b>boolean</b>. In this case, Randoop will interpret a return
value of <code>true</code> as the rep invariant being satisfied, and a
return value of <code>false</code> <i>or</i> an exception escaping the
method as the rep invariant being violated.
</li>

<li>A public instance method with no arguments and return
type <b>void</b>. In this case, Randoop will interpret a normal return
(no exceptions) as the rep invariant being satisfied, and an
exception escaping the method as the rep invariant being violated.
</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="covered-filter">Instrumenting classes for filtering tests on covered-classes</h2>

<p>
  Randoop generates tests that use methods, constructors, and fields of classes
  given using the <code>--testclass</code> and <code>--classlist</code> options.
  Any given test may involve one or more of the classes.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="#option:require-covered-classes"><code>--require-covered-classes</code></a>
  option makes Randoop discard any test that doesn't use at least one of the
  specified classes.
</p>

<p>
  Suppose you only want to test class A, but its methods takes arguments of type
  B and C.  If you supply only A as a test class, Randoop cannot create
  objects of type B and C, so Randoop may be unable to call class A.  Instead,
  you can supply A, B, and C as test classes, but instruct Randoop to only
  output the classes that use A.
</p>

<p>
  Use of the <code>--require-covered-classes</code> option is unusual:  you
  probably care about testing your entire application rather than just part of
  it.  The option makes Randoop less efficient, because Randoop creates but
  discards tests.
</p>

<p>
  For the <code>--require-covered-classes</code> option to work, the classes
  must be instrumented so Randoop can determine when they are covered.  To
  instrument classes for this filter, also use
  the <code>covered-class-4.0.0.jar</code> by giving the following command-line
  option for java
</p>
<pre><code>
-javaagent:$(RANDOOP_PATH)/covered-class-4.0.0.jar
</code></pre>
<p>
  This will instrument any non-abstract constructor and method of loaded
  classes so that the use of a class can be detected.
  (The instrumentation is not done on any JDK or JUnit classes.)
  (The <code>covered-class-4.0.0.jar</code> file can be found in the
    unzipped distribution archive, or can be downloaded from the
    <a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/releases/latest">latest release</a>.)
</p>


<h2 id="primitives">Specifying additional primitive values</h2>

<p>
By default, Randoop uses the following pool of primitive values as
inputs to methods:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>byte</code>: <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> <code>1</code>,  <code>10</code>, <code>100</code></li>
  <li><code>short</code>: <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> <code>1</code>,  <code>10</code>, <code>100</code></li>
  <li><code>int</code>: <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> <code>1</code>,  <code>10</code>, <code>100</code></li>
  <li><code>long</code>: <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> <code>1</code>,  <code>10</code>, <code>100</code></li>
  <li><code>float</code>: <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> <code>1</code>,  <code>10</code>, <code>100</code></li>
  <li><code>double</code>: <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> <code>1</code>,  <code>10</code>, <code>100</code></li>
  <li><code>char</code>: <code>'#'</code>, <code>' '</code>, <code>'4'</code>, <code>'a'</code></li>
  <li><code>java.lang.String</code>: <code>""</code>, <code>"hi!"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the initial set of <i>seed</i> values used by Randoop: in
addition to the above values, any primitive value returned at runtime
from a method call under test may be later used as input to another
method call.</p>

<p>There are two ways of specifying additional seed values to Randoop.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Command line.</b> An easy way to specify additional seed values in
to use the <a href="#option:literals-file"><code>--literals-file</code></a>
or <a href="#option:literals-level"><code>--literals-level</code></a>
command-line option to either use literals from a file you specify or to
read literals out of the source code that Randoop is analyzing.</li>

<li><b>Programmatically.</b> You can declare a class that stores
primitive values, using the <code>@TestValue</code> annotation:

<ol>

  <li> Create a <b>public</b> class <i>C</i>, and import <code>randoop.*</code>.
  </li>

  <li> Declare one more more fields in <i>C</i> that hold the
       values you want to seed. Each field should:

    <ul>
      <li> include the <code>@TestValue</code> annotation,</li>
      <li> be declared <b><code>public</code></b> and <b><code>static</code></b>,</li>
      <li> be of a primitive (or <code>String</code>) type, or an array of primitives or <code>String</code>s, and</li>
      <li> be initialized to contain one or more seed values.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> Include the class you created in the list of classes given to Randoop to test.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can simply add a <code>@TestValue</code> annotation
to a field in one of your classes under test, as long as it adheres to
the above requirements.</p>

<p>Below is an example helper class that demonstrates the use of the
@TestValue annotation. For Randoop to use the primitive values
described in the class, you would add this class to the list of
classes under test
(e.g. via the option <code>--testclass=example.TestValueExamples</code>).</p>

<pre class="code">
  package example;
  import randoop.*;

  public class TestValueExamples {

    @TestValue
    public static int i = 0;

    @TestValue
    public static boolean b = false;

    @TestValue
    public static byte by = 3;

    @TestValue
    public static char c = 'c';

    @TestValue
    public static long l = 3L;

    @TestValue
    public static float f = (float) 1.3;

    @TestValue
    public static double d = 1.4;

    @TestValue
    public static String s1 = null;

    @TestValue
    public static String s2 = "hi";

    @TestValue
    public static int[] a1 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };

  }
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="nondeterminism">Nondeterminism</h2>

<p>
Randoop is deterministic:  if you run Randoop twice, Randoop should output the
same test suite.
</p>

<p>
This section gives several reasons why Randoop may produce different output
when you run it twice, and tells you how to debug the problem.
If after investigating these possibilities, you find that Randoop is
nondeterministic because of a bug in Randoop,
please <a href="#bug-reporting">report it</a> so that we can investigate
and correct the problem.
</p>

<p>
If you <em>want</em> Randoop to produce different test suites, supply
different values for the
<a href="#option:randomseed"><code>--randomseed</code></a> command-line argument.
</p>


<h3 id="nondeterminism-changed-program">Changes to the program or its environment</h3>

<p>
You changed the program or its environment.
</p>

<p>
Changing the JDK counts as a change to the program.
For example, consider a class
</p>
<pre>
public class Corner extends JComponent { ... }
</pre>

<p>
In JDK 7, <code>Corner</code>'s <code>getAccessibleContext</code> method is
inherited from <code>JComponent</code>.
In JDK 8, <code>Corner</code>'s <code>getAccessibleContext</code> method is
inherited from <code>java.awt.Component</code>.
Depending on the JDK in use, Randoop discovers a different set of operations,
because <code>Corner.class.getMethods()</code> returns different results
depending on the JDK.  Given different sets, Randoop may make different
choices and produce different tests.
</p>

<p>
There can be implementation changes even within a single JDK major version,
such as two different versions of JDK 8.  These differences can lead to
different Randoop outputs, or to tests that passed on one JDK
implementation but fail on another.
</p>


<h3 id="nondeterminism-command-line-arguments">Command-line arguments enable nondeterminism</h3>

<p>
You instructed Randoop to behave nondeterministically,
for example by specifying a timeout.  To forbid use of such options, pass
the <a href="#option:randomseed"><code>--deterministic</code></a> command-line
argument.
</p>


<h3 id="nondeterminism-in-program-under-test">Nondeterministic program under test</h3>

<p>
The program under test is nondeterministic.  This can cause Randoop to
produce different tests on different runs, but more seriously, it can cause
Randoop to produce <a href="#flaky-tests">flaky tests</a> that sometimes
pass and sometimes fail.
</p>

<p>
To determine which method is nondeterministic, run Randoop with
the <a href="#option:log"><code>--log</code></a> and
<a href="#option:selection-log"><code>--selection-log</code></a>
command-line options.  Compare the logs across runs, and the first
place that they differ indicates where the program is nondeterministic.
</p>

<p>
If the program under test is nondeterministic, you have several options:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Change the program to be deterministic.
In addition to making the program more testable, this is likely to make the program easier to debug.
Here are some ways to eliminate nondeterminism in a sequential Java program:

<ul>
  <li>
    Some collections have arbitrary iteration order, such as <code>HashMap</code> and <code>HashSet</code>.
    Either sort their results, or replace the data structures by
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a>
    and
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashSet.html"><code>LinkedHashSet</code></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some APIs produce results in arbitrary order, such
    as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html#list--">File.list()</a>
    and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html#listFiles--">File.listFiles()</a>.
    Sort their results before using them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Object.hashCode()</code> depends on where the object is laid out
    in memory, which depends on when the garbage collector
    runs.  <code>Object.toString()</code> depends
    on <code>Object.hashCode()</code>.  Every class should
    override <code>hashCode()</code>, <code>equals()</code> (for
    consistency with <code>hashCode()</code>), and <code>toString()</code>.
    Furthermore, don't instantiate the <code>Object</code> class, as
    in <code>new Object()</code>; instead, use some class that overrides
    the methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't call <code>new Random()</code> without an argument.  Instead, use
    (for example) <code>new Random(0)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't use time and date functions to obtain the current time.
  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Transform the program at run time to make changes like the ones above, replacing
the method's behavior with a different implementation
(such as a deterministic one or a mock).
You can do this by using
Randoop's <a href="#replacecall">replacecall agent</a>.
</li>

<li>
Prevent Randoop from directly calling problematic methods.
Use the <a href="#option:omitmethods"><code>--omitmethods</code></a> 
or <a href="#option:omitmethods_list"><code>--omitmethods-list</code></a>
command-line argument.
</li>

<li>
Instruct Randoop to attempt to discard or repair any flaky tests that it
generates.
Use the
<a href="#option:ignore-flaky-tests"><code>--ignore-flaky-tests</code></a>
command-line argument.
This is a last resort because Randoop may output a small test suite due to
discarding many of the generated tests.
When possible, is better to avoid generating flaky tests
rather than discarding them after generating them.
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="getting_help">Getting help</h1>

<p>You can get help on Randoop in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Manual</strong>: what you are currently reading. </li>

<li><strong>Randoop's <code>help</code> command</strong>:  For help on
  usage, use Randoop's <code>help</code> command. To print Randoop's main help message, run:

<pre class="code">java -classpath $(RANDOOP_JAR) randoop.main.Main help</pre>

To print help for a command (such as <code>gentests</code> or <code>minimize</code>), supply it:

<pre class="code">

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3 id="cannot-find-main">Randoop does not run</h3>

<p>
  If the command to run Randoop has the output
</p>
<pre>
Cannot find or load randoop.main.Main
</pre>
<p>
then Randoop is not properly included in the classpath.
One possibility is that you have included the Randoop jar file in the path
specified by the <code>CLASSPATH</code> variable, but have given the location of
the classes-under-test with the <code>-classpath</code> option at the command line.
In this case, the <code>java</code> command will only use the classpath from
<code>-classpath</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that both Randoop and the classes under test be included as
the argument to the <code>-classpath</code> option to the <code>java</code> command.
It only makes sense to set <code>CLASSPATH</code> to run Randoop if the location
of classes-under-test will be the same each time you run it.
See the Java Tutorial on
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html">path and classpaths</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If the command to run Randoop has the output
</p>
<pre>
Cannot find the Java compiler. Check that classpath includes tools.jar
</pre>
<p>
  then you have installed Java incorrectly.
  You perhaps have the JRE on your path before the JDK.
  Ensure that <code>JAVA_HOME</code> appears at the <em>front</em> of your path.
  If you run the Windows operating system, see the
  <a href="https://douglascayers.com/2015/05/30/how-to-set-custom-java-path-after-installing-jdk-8/">instructions for setting a custom Java path after installing JDK 8</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="no-class-found">Randoop cannot find class-under-test</h3>

<p>
  If when Randoop is run, something like the following is output
</p>
<pre>
No class found for type name "example.ExampleClass"
</pre>
<p>
  then the classes under test are not in the classpath.
  The most likely case is that you have not included the path to these classes.
  Otherwise, the classpath is not given properly.
  In particular, if you are running Randoop on Windows, parts of the classpath should be
  separated by a semi-colon ";" instead of the colon ":" shown in the examples
  in this document.
  See the Java Tutorial on
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html">paths and classpaths</a>
  for platform specific information on paths.
</p>


<h3 id="not-enough-tests-created">Randoop does not create enough tests, or creates no tests</h3>

<p>
if Randoop's generated tests do not cover some part of your code (or if
Randoop outputs "No tests were created. No JUnit class created."), then you
need to change Randoop's parameters and re-run it.  Spending just a little
bit of effort may have a big impact on the quality of Randoop's output.
</p>

<p>
Consider some specific method that Randoop does not call, and determine why
Randoop does not call that method.  Run Randoop
with <a href="#optiongroup:Logging,-notifications,-and-troubleshooting-Randoop">logging
enabled</a>.  Here is an incomplete list of possible problems and
solutions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Randoop never tries to call the method.  You should run Randoop with a
    larger timeout, or run Randoop with fewer classes, or exclude some
    classes or methods from consideration.  You might also
    <a href="#nontermination">avoid using
    <code>--usethreads</code></a>, which can make Randoop run very slowly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Randoop tries to call the method, but is unable to create inputs.
    You should give Randoop more classes to analyze.
  </li>
  <li>
    Randoop calls the method, but is unable to create valid/useful inputs.
    You should investigate why Randoop is unable to create the needed
    inputs.  Maybe you need to give Randoop more classes to analyze, or
    provide <a href="#primitives">additional primitive values</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p id="no-input-generation"> <!-- short id to keep the full URL on one line -->
If Randoop gets stuck, it outputs
"*** Randoop has spent over 10 seconds executing the following test.",
but it does not output any tests.
Randoop creates and executes one test at a time, so
a long-running sequence will prevent Randoop from creating new tests.
Two possible reasons for a long-running test are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Randoop is executing a test that contains nonterminating behavior,
    or that takes very long to execute.

    <p>
    The best solution is to determine the long-running method, then
    fix it (if it is buggy) or exclude Randoop from calling it.
    Here are ways to determine which method took a long time to execute:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Examine the stack traces that Randoop prints.</li>
      <li>Examine the test that Randoop was running.</li>
      <li>Run the test that Randoop was running.</li>
      <li>Run Randoop with command-line options
	<code>--usethreads --log=randoop.log</code>,
	and examine the logs, which report which methods were terminated
	because they ran for too long.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Another possibility is to run Randoop with the command-line option
    <a href="#option:usethreads"><code>--usethreads=true</code></a>,
    without fixing the method or excluding it from Randoop.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Java has run out of memory and is thrashing.
    This explanation is likely if Randoop had become progressively slower
    before getting stuck; examine Randoop's progress output to see if this
    is the case.
    Give Java more memory by running <code>java</code> with,
    say, <code>-Xmx3000m</code>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="nontermination">Randoop does not terminate</h3>

<p>
If Randoop does not terminate, that might be because Randoop is creating
tests that do not terminate (or that execute for a very long time).
Here are three ways to deal with the problem.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Determine which calls are executing by examining the stack trace.
    Use the <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jstack.html"><code>jstack</code></a>
    command, which you can run as <code>jstack <em>pid</em></code>.
    Get the process id by running <code>jcmd</code>.
    (On Unix you can also type <code>Ctrl-\</code>; that is, hold down the
    Control key, then press the Backslash key.)  If the same methods appear
    in multiple such stack traces, then you
    can <a href="#specifying-methods">exclude them from consideration by
    Randoop</a> or <a href="#replacecall">prevent the JVM from calling the
    method</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run Randoop with the command-line option
    <a href="#option:usethreads"><code>--usethreads=true</code></a>.
    This will cause Randoop to discard tests in
    which any directly-called method takes
    <a href="#option:usethreads"><code>too long</code></a> to run.

    If you suspect the problem may be a bug in Randoop, use the
    <code>--log=filename</code> command-line option, and either examine the
    log or send it to the Randoop developers for diagnosis.

<h3 id="different-output">Randoop produces different output on different runs</h3>

<p>
See the manual section on <a href="#nondeterminism">nondeterminism</a>.

<h3 id="flaky-tests">Randoop stopped because of a flaky test</h3>

<p>
A test is <i>flaky</i> if it behaves differently on different executions.
</p>
  
<!--
<p>
Randoop extends previously-generated tests by adding new method calls to them.
If, in the new longer test, one of the embedded subtests throws an exception
(even though when previously run on its own, the subtest passed),
then we say the test is <i>flaky</i>.
</p>
-->

<p>
There are two main reasons for flaky tests.  One is global side effects:  a
Randoop-generated test might call a method that sets a static field or
creates/deletes a file.  (Calling Randoop on a method that side-effects
local state, such as a field of the receiver or of an argument, is fine.)
Another reason is nondeterminism:  the program under test might behave
differently on different runs.  Such behaviors are not appropriate for in
unit tests, so you should not call Randoop on such methods.
</p>

<p>
If Randoop encounters a flaky test, Randoop halts so that you
can <a href="#nondeterminism-in-program-under-test">correct your invocation
of Randoop</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you find a flaky test that does not result from side effects or
nondeterminism in the program, then please help us improve Randoop by
submitting an issue via the
<a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/issues" rel="nofollow">issue
tracker</a>.
<!-- True, but doesn't add much to the manual.
(Randoop already discards any test with a flaky occurrence of an
<code>OutOfMemoryError</code> or <code>StackOverflowError</code> as invalid.
Additional information can help us find other heuristics that avoid generating
flaky tests, or improve this documentation.)
-->
</p>


<h3 id="regression-tests-do-not-pass">Randoop produces a regression test suite that does not pass</h3>

<p>
Randoop outputs regression tests that passed during test generation.  If
the regression tests fail when you run them, they are said to be flaky.
This is due to nondeterminism in the program under test.
See the manual section on <a href="#nondeterminism">nondeterminism</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="dependent-tests">Tests behave differently in isolation or when reordered</h3>

<p>
Another symptom of calling Randoop on methods that have global side effects, in
addition to <a href="#flaky-tests">flaky tests</a>, is
<a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/test-independence-issta2014-abstract.html">dependent
tests</a>:  tests that behave differently depending on whether some other
test has already run.  For instance, test B might succeed if run after test
A, but fail if run on its own.
</p>

<p>
You can either always run Randoop's generated tests in the same order
(without performing test selection, prioritization, or parallelization),
or you can avoid calling Randoop on methods with global side effects as
described in the section on <a href="#flaky-tests">flaky tests</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another possible symptom is that if you run Randoop's tests and then your
original test suite, the original test suite might fail because of side
effects performed by Randoop's tests.
To avoid this problem, you can run Randoop's tests in a separate JVM, or
run Randoop's tests last, or avoid calling Randoop on methods with global
side effects as described in the section on <a href="#flaky-tests">flaky
tests</a>.

<h2 id="bug-reporting">Reporting a bug to the issue tracker</h2>

<p>
  If
  you have discovered a problem with Randoop, we would like to fix it.
  Please submit an issue to the
  <a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/issues"
  rel="nofollow">issue tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You should include enough information to
  enable the Randoop developers to reproduce the problem, which will make
  it easier for them to diagnose the problem, fix Randoop, and verify the
  fix.  This generally includes
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the version of Randoop (please use the most recent released version,
      or the current version from the
      <a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop">GitHub version control repository</a>),</li>
    <li>the exact commands you ran (please use the <code>-ea</code> option to
       <code>java</code> when running Randoop, which makes diagnosis easier),</li>
    <li>the exact and complete output of the commands, and</li>
    <li>all the files that are necessary to run those commands.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Never submit just a screenshot or image of your computer screen.
  Instead, cut-and-paste the text of your command and its output.  The text
  is easier to read, is searchable, and does not require transcribing from
  a screenshot in order to reproduce.
</p>

<p>
  If you encountered the problem while using the Maven plug-in,
  then please reproduce the problem from the command line, to help the
  Randoop developers find the underlying bug (or to isolate the problem to the plug-in).
</p>
