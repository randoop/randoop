/**
 * An execution visitor that chains a list of visitors in sequence. It can be
 * used if the user wants to use more than one visitor to visit a sequence
 * during execution.
 * 
 * When the visitBefore method is called on this visitor, it calls visitMethod
 * on each of the sub-visitors in the order in which the sub-visitors were given
 * when constructing this visitor.
 * 
 * When the visitAfter method is called on this visitor, it calls visitAfter on
 * each of the sub-visitors in turn, also in the order in which they were given
 * when constructing the visitor. If one of these calls returns false, this
 * visitor immediately returns false without calling visitAfter on the remaining
 * visitors.
