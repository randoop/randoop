// A better name for Check would be SequenceDecoration.

/**
 * A Check represents the expected runtime behavior of a Sequence, at a
 * particular offset.  When a unit test is run as a regression test, it
 * should have the same behavior as it did previously, and the Check
 * objects represent that previous, expected behavior.  Some examples of
 * Checks are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ExpectedExceptionCheck} -- an exception should be thrown
 *   <li>{@link NoExceptionCheck} -- no exception should be thrown
 *   <li>{@link ObjectCheck} -- a particular {@link ObjectContract} should hold
 * </ul>
 *
 * The visitor classes decorate a sequence with <code>Check</code> objects.
 * A <code>Check</code> object is inserted as a decoration on a
 * specific index of an {@link ExecutableSequence}. Thus, a check is
 * always associated with a specific index in a sequence. A check at
 * index i means that the check is to be performed after statement i
 * finishes executing.
 * 
 * <p>
 *
 * A check implements two methods that specify the code to be
 * emitted before and/or after a statement in a <code>Sequence</code>
 * is executed.
 *
 * <p>
 * 
 * A check may require some code to be emitted before and/or after the
 * statement is printed. For example, a check for checking that
 * <code>x</code> is not null after the statement "<code>Foo x =
 * m()</code>" is executed might emit the assertion code
 * "<code>assertNotNull(x);</code>", and would do so after the
 * statement is printed. As a second example, a check for checking
 * that an expected exception is thrown by a statement would need to
 * emit something like "<code>try {</code>" before the statement, and
 * the catch clause after the statement.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Checks are Serializable so that an <code>ExecutableSequence</code> can be
 * serialized along with its associated checks.
