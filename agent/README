This directory ('randoop/agent') holds subprojects for Java agents
(load-time bytecode transformers) to be used with Randoop.  Each
subdirectory also occurs as a subproject name in 'randoop/settings.gradle',
which includes the subproject into the Randoop build.

For a subproject named 'an-agent', the settings file contains a line
`include 'an-agent'`, and assumes that the subproject occurs in the directory
'randoop/agent/an-agent' and has a build script
'randoop/agent/an-agent/an-agent.gradle'.
The agent manifest is generated by the subproject build script.

Note that 'randoop/build.gradle' applies the Java plugin for all projects.
