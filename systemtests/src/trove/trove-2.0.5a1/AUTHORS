Please do NOT email bug reports or feature requests.

Instead use the very fine bug tracking system and feature request
service on SourceForge:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/trove4j/
I'll read your issue just as quickly, and the project's issues will
remain out in the open where everyone can see them.  I also monitor
the project fora, so feel free to use those too.
