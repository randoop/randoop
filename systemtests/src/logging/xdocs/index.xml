<section name="The Logging Component">

<p>There is a great need for debugging and logging information inside of
Commons components such as HTTPClient and DBCP.  However, there are many
logging APIs out there and it is difficult to choose among them.</p>

<p>The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
libraries.  Commons components may use the Logging API to remove
compile-time and run-time dependencies on any particular logging package,
and contributors may write Log implementations for the library of
their choice.</p>
