Version 3.0.0, released ????

Randoop now tracks types independently of the Java reflection classes. This
means for generic classes it will select a type argument for each type parameter
and use that selection consistently. This will avoid compile and run time type
errors related to inconsistent use of a parameterized type.

Randoop implements the Object.equals() transitivity contract, which was
previously documented but unimplemented.

Randoop will now generate longer arrays for reference types. Element types must
be primitive, boxed primitive, or be input with --testclass.

Fixed a bug where the opening parenthesis was not being generated for a call to
the constructor of a non-static inner class.

The following command-line arguments have been removed: -output-tests-serialized,
--componentfile-ser, --componentfile-txt, --output-components

For developers: Randoop is now built using Gradle (with the Gradle Wrapper).
File organization has changed to the default used by Gradle Java plugin.
See the developer manual for details.

Version 2.1.4, released February 24, 2016

Fixed a bug in --include-if-class-exercised that was including too many tests.
The option now requires that Randoop be run with -javaagent:exercised_agent.jar.
Also, modified the option so that allow any class, and not just those specified
by --testclass or --classlist. This change allows abstract classes, which cannot
be given to --testclass.

The Java agent jar files are now part of distribution files and can be found in
dist after running 'make distribution-files'. The agent jar randoop_agent.jar
has been renamed to mapcall_agent.jar.

Fixed code generation in --junit_reflection_allowed so that generated
driver file will compile.

Renamed command-line arguments --{error,regression}-test-filename to
--{error,regression}-test-basename.

Documented that Randoop may create dependent tests whose outcome depends
on the order in which they are run, and what to do about it.


Version 2.1.3, released February 5, 2016

Renamed command-line argument --include-only-classes to
--include-if-classname-appears.  Clarified that a test is output only if
the test's source code textually uses some member from the classes.

New command-line argument --include-if-class-exercised causes Randoop to
output only tests that execute some method in the given classes, whether or
not the method appears in the source code of the test.

Changed command-line argument defaults to forbid-null=false and
--null-ratio=0.05.

Fixed a bug in which a primitive type would be selected as a receiver of a
method call.


Version 2.1.2, released January 26, 2016

Fixed issues related to filtering of classes and members so that Randoop ignores:
- public methods/constructors with package private parameter types, and
- synthetic constructor with anonymous parameter (generated for
  private constructor of outer class used by inner class).
Thanks to Rene Just and Gordon Fraser.


Version 2.1.1, released January 22, 2016

Randoop now prints nicer error information when it halts after encountering a
flaky test (a test in which an exception is thrown elsewhere than at the last
statement).  This flaky behavior is usually due to nondeterminism or to side
effects on global state.  So, the best solution is to not run Randoop on
methods that are nondeterministic or that side-effect global state.
Alternately, you can use the --ignore-flaky-tests option to make Randoop discard
flaky tests and proceed.

Randoop is now package-access-aware in determining which class members to
include in a test.  If --junit-package-name is set to the package of a
class under test, the tests will include non-private members of the
class. Restrict tests to only public members by setting
--only-test-public-members.

Fixed issue #78:  Number objects were tested for equality with Double.Nan
or Float.Nan without a cast.
Fixed issue #80: package access fields can now be set and read.
Fixed issue where evaluating a contract resulted in an IllegalArgumentException.
Thanks to Juan Pablo Galeotti, Rene Just, and Gordon Fraser.


Version 2.1.0, released December 30, 2015

Randoop now splits generated tests into three categories: error-revealing,
regression, and invalid. Error-revealing and regression are now output as
separate test suites rather than combining all tests into a single suite.
(Invalid tests are discarded.) Also, new command-line options allow the
classification of exceptions to control how tests are categorized.

Both error-revealing and regression tests are output by default. Each category
is output only if a test of that category is generated. Use the command-line
arguments --no-error-revealing-tests and --no-regression-tests to disable
generation of one or the other of the suites. Use --error-test-filename and
--regression-test-filename to set the file names. These command-line
arguments replace the arguments --check-object-contracts,
--check-regression-behavior and --junit-classname that have been removed.

Tests where exceptions are thrown are classified by how exceptions are
assigned types of behavior. A test with with an exception that is INVALID
behavior is invalid, one with an exception that is ERROR behavior (and none
that are INVALID) is an error-revealing test, and one with no INVALID or ERROR
behaviors and an exception that is an EXPECTED behavior is a regression test.
Customize the classification of exceptions by setting the behavior type for
exceptions using the command-line arguments --checked-exception,
--unchecked-exception, --npe-on-null-input, --npe-on-non-null-input,
and --oom-exception.
(Issues #20, #69 and #72)

Additional changes:

You can control whether assertions appear in regression tests with the new
command-line argument --no-regression-assertions.

The command line --test-classes has been changed to --include-only-classes to
distance meaning from --testclass argument. (Addresses #66)

The command-line arguments --simplify-failed-tests, --remove-subsequences,
--compare-checks, --clean-checks, --print-diff-obs and --output-nonexec have
been removed. The command option exec has been removed.

Support for the Eclipse plugin has been removed. The option --comp-port has been
removed.

The interface for ExecutionVisitor has been changed to visitAfterStatement and
visitBeforeStatement to clarify that the methods are invoked relative to the
execution of each statement. Note that an ExecutionVisitor may no longer modify
the Checks for a Sequence.

This release fixes a bug in which a public method inherited from a package
private class was being excluded from testing. (Thanks to Alberto Goffi for
raising the issue and providing a concise example.)


Version 2.0.1, released November 30, 2015

Fixed a bug in the variable names for generated array declarations.

Randoop now generates tests involving fields (fixes issues #21 and #47).
A Randoop-generated test previously only invoked methods; now the
generated tests may access and set fields as well.  Use command-line
option --omit-field-list to make Randoop ignore certain fields.

Randoop now includes enums in generated tests (fixes issue #17).

JUnit now executes Randoop-generated tests in a deterministic order:
in ascending order by name.

The Randoop Eclipse plugin has moved into its own repository:
https://github.com/randoop/randoop-eclipse-plugin


Version 2.0, released October 13, 2015

The Randoop homepage is now http://randoop.github.io/randoop/ .
Moved the Randoop version control repository to its own GitHub organization:
it now appears at https://github.com/randoop/randoop
(previously https://github.com/mernst/randoop).

Randoop now outputs JUnit 4 tests (previously JUnit 3 tests).
These can be run from the command line using a command such as

  java -classpath .:$JUNITPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore RandoopTest

If command-line argument --junit-reflection-allowed=false is set when
running Randoop, then Randoop instead produces a Main class that calls each
of the test methods individually, without using reflection.

Created a new mailing list, randoop-discuss@googlegroups.com, for
discussions with Randoop users.  It is open to join and should be easier to
search than the existing randoop-developers@googlegroups.com mailing list.


Version 1.3.6, released August 10, 2015

Command-line-argument --junit-reflection-allowed=false causes Randoop to
avoid use of JUnit's reflective test invocation.  Use of direct method
calls instead can make Randoop's generated tests easier to analyze.

Changed default for --literals-level to CLASS.

Improvements in treatment of observer methods:  put observer results in the
pool, but not receivers after observer invocations.  If you are not using
observers when you run Randoop, then you are not using Randoop as intended
and Randoop may be generating sub-optimal test suites.

Fix bugs, notably:
 * #18 Handle non-visible thrown exceptions
 * #51 Use better variable names in generated tests
 * Use equals, not ==, to compare NaN

Many documentation improvements, including clarifications and
restructuring.  The manual mentions the Maven plug-in and explains that
Randoop is deterministic but your sequential Java program may not be.

Not directly related to Randoop, but possibly of interest to Randoop users:
ABB Corporation has released an improved version of Randoop.NET.  Compared to
the original version of Randoop.NET from Microsoft Research:
 * It fixes some bugs.
 * It adds new features, notably regression assertions for more effective
   regression testing, method transformers to delete or replace calls to
   specific methods in the assembly, and richer debug information collection.
 * It adds a GUI, as a VS2010 add-in.
The Java implementation of Randoop continues to have more features than
Randoop.NET, but ABB's improvements make the .NET tool more usable.


Version 1.3.5, released May 28, 2015

Command-line argument --check-regression-behavior controls whether the tests
include assertions about the current behavior.

Command-line argument --observers lets you provide a file listing observer
functions.

The Randoop homepage is now http://mernst.github.io/randoop/ .

Moved the Randoop version control repository from Google Code to GitHub,
and from the Mercurial version control system to Git.

Randoop now compiles, and its tests pass, under Java 8.


Version 1.3.4, released January 1, 2014

Bug fixes:
 * String lengths are checked correctly
 * No global timeout when per-thread timeout is in force
 * Better agent flag parsing
 * Don't output code like "catch (null e)".

Documentation:
 * Add troubleshooting section about no tests being created
 * Tips on reporting a bug
 * Documentation for building a release
