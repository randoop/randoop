<h1 id="starting">Getting Started</h1>

<p>Clone the repository:</p>

<pre>
  git clone git@github.com:randoop/randoop.git
</pre>

<p>
  When working on a particular feature, create a new
  branch and work there rather
  than in the <i>master</i> branch.
</p>


<h1 id="tasks">Compiling, testing, releasing, etc.</h1>


<h2 id="compiling">Building and Testing Randoop</h2>

<p>
  In Randoop's top-level directory, run
</p>
<pre>  ./gradlew build</pre>
<p>
  This command compiles Randoop, compiles the Java agents, runs all tests,
  and builds the jar files.
  Generated files are
  placed in subdirectories named <code>build</code> in the parent directory and in
  each of the agent subdirectories.
  Jar files are placed in directory <code>build/libs</code>.
</p>

<p>
  You can also break this process down by running separate tasks.
  For the full list of tasks supported by the Randoop build script, type
  <code>./gradlew tasks</code>.
  Particular tasks that may be useful during development include
</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew jar</code></td>
    <td>to build the jar files</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew assemble</code></td>
    <td>to compile and build jar files,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew check</code></td>
    <td>to run the all of the tests</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew testReport</code></td>
    <td>to generate HTML reports from tests
      (in <tt>build/reports/allTests</tt>),</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew clean</code></td>
    <td>to remove the <tt>build</tt> subdirectory,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew compileJava</code></td>
    <td>to compile the <tt>main</tt> source set,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew compileTestJava</code></td>
    <td>to compile the <tt>test</tt> source set,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>./gradlew compileAgentTestJava</code></td>
    <td>to compile the <tt>agentTest</tt> source set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Compiling uses the concept of
  <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html"><i>source sets</i></a>.
  A source set is a grouping of source files that can have its own set of
  dependencies and tasks.
  The 
  For instance, in the Randoop <tt>build.gradle</tt> there is the
  <tt>agentTest</tt> source set that is separate from the <tt>test</tt> source
  set because the test classes must run using the <tt>exercised-class</tt> Java
  agent.
  The plugin normally has two source sets named <tt>main</tt> and <tt>test</tt>,
  and the Randoop build script defines others to better structure the build process.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some Gradle tricks that may be useful:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gradle allows you to run multiple tasks.  For instance, for a clean build,
    type <code>./gradlew clean build</code>.</li>
  <li><p>You can run a task <tt>taskName</tt> on individual classes by setting the
    system property <code>taskName.single</code> on the command line.
    For instance, to run just the tests in <tt>RandoopSystemTest</tt> use the
    command<br />
    <code><pre>
      ./gradlew -Dtest.single=RandoopSystemTest test
    </pre></code></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="gradlew">The <code>./gradlew</code> script</h3>

<p>
Randoop is built with Gradle.
The script named <tt>./gradlew</tt> is the Gradle wrapper
for the project, and is the recommended way to run Gradle commands.
Using the wrapper means you don't have to install Gradle yourself, instead
the wrapper will download Gradle the first time you run a build command.
</p>

<p>
To learn more about Gradle beyond the basic commands
given here, see the Gradle
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_gradle_command_line.html">command-line tutorial</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="usinganide">Using an IDE</h2>

<p>
  Effort has been made to accommodate the use of IDEs in developing Randoop,
  but you should still use the command line to ensure everything is being built
  properly.
</p>

<p>
  Based on experiments with IDEs in March 2016, IntelliJ IDEA and NetBeans
  with the IDEA plugin are the only plugin/tool combinations that actually
  worked without any/major manual reconfiguration.
  For both, type
</p>
<pre>
  ./gradlew idea
</pre>
<p>
  at the command line in the Randoop directory.
  This uses the
  <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/idea_plugin.html">IntelliJ IDEA plugin</a>
  to create IDEA configuration files that both tools use when importing the project.
</p>

<p>
  To use NetBeans with Randoop, you will also need to install the
  <a href="https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project">NetBeans plugin</a>,
  but IntelliJ IDEA should import the project without anything additional though
  you'll want to follow it's suggestions on configuring Gradle support.
  Building the project in NetBeans works like running <code>./gradlew build</code>,
  while with IDEA you will need to set the command you want to run in the Gradle
  tool.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the IntelliJ IDEA plugin, the build script for Randoop includes
  the
  <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/eclipse_plugin.html">Eclipse plugin</a>.
  With both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, it is possible to import Randoop as a
  Gradle project, but it seems to work slightly better to use the Gradle-side
  plugins to create the configuration files for each tool.
  To generate Eclipse-specific project configuration files, type the command:
</p>
<code><pre>
  ./gradlew eclipse</code>
</pre></code>
<p>
  Once you've run the task you want, you will be able to import Randoop as a
  native project within Eclipse.
  However, as mentioned above, expect that you'll have to tweak the
  project settings within your IDE for it to build/run correctly.
  Also, when we tried it, the Eclipse build model did not match the Gradle build,
  breaking most of the instructions in this document.
</p>

<p>
  Other than <tt>.gitignore</tt>, the tool-specific settings are not part of the
  repository.
  If you should tweak the Gradle configuration in <tt>build.gradle</tt> to
  better support a particular tool, also verify that it doesn't change behavior
  from the command line using the Gradle wrapper.
</p>


<h2 id="classpath">Randoop classpath</h2>

<p>
To run Randoop, your classpath must include either the Randoop class files or
the Randoop jar file, and also must include <tt>lib/plume.jar</tt>.
After the build, the classpath should include either of the following
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>
&lt;randoop-path&gt;/build/libs/randoop-2.1.4.jar:&lt;randoop-path&gt;/lib/plume.jar
</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>
&lt;randoop-path&gt;/build/build/classes/main:&lt;randoop-path&gt;/lib/plume.jar
</code> </li>
</ul>
<p>
It is recommended that the classpath for classes under test be placed before
Plume-lib.
</p>

<p>
To run one of the Java agents, the jar files for Java agents are located in
the <code>build/libs</code> subdirectory of both the Randoop project and the
agent project directories.
So, for instance, the following will work to run the <tt>exercised-class</tt> agent:
</p>
<code><pre>
  -javaagent:&lt;randoop-path&gt;/build/libs/exercised-class-2.1.4.jar
</pre></code>


<h2 id="maintenance">Maintaining Randoop</h2>

<h3 id="maintaininglibraries">Updating libraries</h3>

<p>
  Most of the libraries that Randoop uses are managed in the Gradle build script
  <tt>build.gradle</tt>. Running Gradle will download the library files needed
  to compile Randoop for those libraries that are listed in the build script.
  However, Randoop also uses other libraries that are kept in the <tt>lib</tt>
  directory.
  Periodically, these libraries, and those used in <tt>build.gradle</tt> should
  be updated.
</p>
<p>
  Instructions for updating the "local" libraries can be found in
  <tt>lib/README</tt> while version numbers and links to the other libraries
  can be found in the Gradle build scripts, and should also be checked and updated
  periodically. The build files include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>randoop/build.gradle</tt></li>
  <li><tt>randoop/agent/exercised-class/exercised-class.gradle</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>
  and the library information occurs in configuration blocks for plugins,
  dependencies, and the Gradle wrapper task.
</p>

<h3 id="documentingchanges">Documenting Changes</h3>

<p>
  Any user-visible changes should be documented in the changelog
  <code>doc/CHANGES.txt</code>.
  Be sure to describe the change in terms of how it affects the user.
  List any bug fixes that may affect any user visible behavior, and mention
  any reported issues, and the person who reported the issue.
  Order listed information by importance to the user and subsequent release.
  This text is used for documenting releases, so keeping it up-to-date and
  ready for public release saves time in the long run.
</p>


<h3 id="codeformatting">Formatting Randoop Source Code</h3>

<p>
  The Randoop source code is formatted in
  <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Format</a>
  by using the
   <a href="https://github.com/google/google-java-format">google-java-format</a>
  tool.
  The RandoopGradle build script is setup to allow this tool to be applied using
  the following commands:
  (Please read cautions below before running the tool.)
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>./gradlew googleJavaFormat</code> (or <tt>goJF</tt>) to reformat
    all Java files in the repository. (CAUTION!)</li>
  <li><code>./gradlew verifyGoogleJavaFormat</code> (or <tt>verGJF</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>CAUTION</b>: The first command will change every single Java file in the
  repository, and should not be done before submitting a Pull Request against a
  branch that is out of format. Instead, make sure that the base branch is
  reformatted before creating the PR.
</p>


<h3 id="modmanual">Modifying the manual</h3>

<p>
The documentation for Randoop is in the subdirectory <tt>doc</tt>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>doc/index.html</code> has the user manual.
  Note: the command-line argument documentation is extracted from the code.
  This file is automatically updated if you change Javadoc documentation for
  a method annotated by
  <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/plume-lib/api/plume/Options.html"><code>@Options</code></a>.</li>
<li> <code>doc/dev.html</code> is this developer manual.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Running the command <code>./gradlew manual</code> will create the Javadoc for
Randoop, update command-line arguments in the user documentation, and update the
table-of-contents in both manuals (in the <tt>doc</tt> directory).
The files are placed in <tt>build/docs</tt>, with the Javadoc in
<tt>build/docs/api</tt>, and the updated manual files in <tt>build/docs/manual</tt>.
</p>



<h2 id="making_new_dist">Releasing a New Version of Randoop</h2>

<p>
Throughout, if you push commits to the GitHub repository, ensure that the tests
continue to pass at
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/randoop/randoop">https://travis-ci.org/randoop/randoop</a>.  They currently pass if this icon is green:
<img src="https://travis-ci.org/randoop/randoop.svg?branch=master" alt="Randoop Travis status icon"/>
</p>

<p>
You can preemptively find most problems that Travis will find by running the
commands
</p>
<code><pre>
./gradlew clean assemble check manual
</pre></code>
<p>
locally before doing a push to GitHub.
Though, it may be that some build problems may not occur without a clean project
build, and so it is a good idea to push a branch to the Randoop repository before
merging new work with the master branch.
</p>

<p>
  To make a release from the master branch, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Be sure that everything related to
    <a href="#maintenance">maintenance</a>
    is up-to-date.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pull, or clone, the Randoop gh-pages branch in a sibling subdirectory:
    <pre>
      (cd ../randoop-gh-pages && git pull) \
      || (cd .. && git clone git@github.com:randoop/randoop.git randoop-gh-pages \
          && cd randoop-gh-pages && git checkout gh-pages)
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Increment the Randoop version number:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set environment variables for the old and new version numbers.  (Don't use the examples given here!)
        <pre>
  OLDVERSION=<em>2.1.4</em>
  NEWVERSION=<em>2.1.5</em></pre>
        These are used for working with git.
      </li>
      <li>Also, update the version number and date in
        <tt>build.gradle</tt>,
        <code>src/main/java/randoop/Globals.java</code>,
        <code>doc/CHANGES.txt</code>, and
        <code>doc/index.html</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Commit any changes; push any unpushed
    commits.  Find out if any exist by running:
    <pre>git status && git log --branches --not --remotes</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Compile and test.  If any tests fail, fix them and start over.
    <pre>./gradlew clean build</pre>
  </li>
  <li>You should have been updating the changelog <code>doc/CHANGES.txt</code>
    all along, but double-check by running a command such as this:
    <pre>git log v$OLDVERSION..</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that the manual HTML is valid; commit any necessary changes:
    <pre>./gradlew manual</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once there are no more changes to make:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Commit and push any changes, and make a
    repository tag:
    <pre>
  git commit . -m "Update version to $NEWVERSION"
  git push
  git tag -a v$NEWVERSION -m "Randoop version $NEWVERSION"
  git push --tags</pre>
    <!-- The gh-pages branch is not tagged. -->
  </li>
  <li>Create the distribution files with <code>./gradlew clean build manual</code></li>
  <li>
    Update the <tt>gh-pages</tt> branch using the sibling clone of the repository
    created above:
    <pre>
  mv -f build/docs/manual ../randoop-gh-pages/
  mv -f build/docs/api ../randoop-gh-pages/
  (cd ../randoop-gh-pages && git commit -m "Update for Randoop $NEWVERSION" && git push)</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/">GitHub instructions for creating a release</a>;
    in particular, start at
    <a href="https://github.com/randoop/randoop/releases">https://github.com/randoop/randoop/releases</a>,
    click "Tags", click "add release notes" for the new tag (e.g., v<em>2.1.5</em>),
    name it "Randoop version <em>2.1.5</em>", use the changelog entry as the
    description (but remove any line breaks and check the preview), upload the
    jar files from <tt>build/libs</tt>, and, finally, click "publish release".
  </li>
  <li>Email an announcement to randoop-discuss@googlegroups.com.
    <br/>
    Subject: Randoop version <em>2.1.5</em>
    <br/>
    Randoop <em>2.1.5</em> has been released and is available at
    https://github.com/randoop/randoop/releases/.  The changelog appears below.
  </li>
</ol>


<h1 id="file-organization">Project Directory Organization</h1>

<p>
Randoop has the following directory organization:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>agent</i> - subprojects for Java agents (load-time bytecode rewriting)</li>
  <li> <i>doc</i> - documentation, such as this manual</li>
  <li> <i>lib</i> - jar files for local copies of libraries not available via Maven</li>
  <li> <i>src</i> - source directories for Randoop, including
    <ul>
      <li><i>main</i> - Randoop source code</li>
      <li><i>test</i> - source for JUnit tests of Randoop</li>
      <li><i>agenttest</i> - source for JUnit tests of the exercised-class Java agent</li>
      <li><i>testinput</i> - source for libraries used in Randoop testing</li>
      <li><i>systemtest</i> - source for Randoop system tests
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The source directories follow the conventions of the Gradle Java plugin, where
each directory has a <i>java</i> subdirectory containing Java source, and,
in some cases, a <i>resources</i> subdirectory containing other files.
</p>

<p>
  There is also a <i>gradle</i> directory with the Gradle Wrapper, but you
  shouldn't need to do anything with it.
</p>


<h1 id="randoop_internals">Randoop Internals</h1>

<p>
This section describes Randoop's main concepts, data structures and
internal algorithms. To this end, it helps to understand our model of
unit tests.
</p>

<h2 id="unit_tests">Unit test concepts</h2>

<p>
A unit test is a snippet of code that checks
some expected property of some classes under test.
It is helpful to think of a unit test as consisting of <i>two</i> things:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A test input</b>:  the portions of the code that call
constructors and method of the classes under test; this is sometimes called the setup code.</li>
<li><b>Checking code</b> or assertions or the &ldquo;test oracle&rdquo;: the
portion of the code that <i>checks</i> that the test input behaves as
expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a simple example, suppose we're testing the JDK's collections
classes (<code>LinkedList</code>, <code>Collections</code>, etc.)  The
following unit test checks that the size of a linked list is computed
correctly after an element is added.
</p>

<pre class="code">
1.   // Tests that the size of a list is 1 after adding an element.
2.   public void testAdd() {
3.      LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
4.      boolean b = list.add(null);
5.      assert list.size() == 1;
6.   }
</pre>

<p>
The test input consists of lines 3-4, which creates a list and calls the
<code>add</code> method, exercising the code of the list class under
test. The test check is in line 5.
</p>

<p>
In Randoop, test inputs are represented using
<a href="javadoc/randoop/Sequence.html">Sequences</a>, which describe
a sequence of <a href="javadoc/randoop/Statement.html">Statement</a>s
(like the statements in lines 3-4 above)
exercising the code under test, and test checks are represented
using <a href="javadoc/randoop/Check.html">Checks</a>.
</p>

<p>
Randoop's generation algorithms basically create collections of
Sequences, add the appropriate Checks to them, and output the results
to the user as unit tests.
</p>

<h2 id="sequence">Sequences</h2>

<p>
Randoop's main data structure is the
<a href="javadoc/randoop/Sequence.html">Sequence</a>.  A sequence
describes the syntactic structure of a test input. In Randoop, all
test inputs are sequences of operations that use the methods and
constructors of the classes under test.
</p>

<p>
Continuing with our running example,
here is an example of a sequence of statements that calls
methods from the classes under test, which each statement on a
separate line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  LinkedList l = new LinkedList();
  Object o = new Object();
  l.addFirst(o);
  int i = l.size();
  TreeSet t = new TreeSet(l);
  Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(t);
</pre>

<p>
Notice that each statement has three elements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A specific method (or constructor) that is being called.</li>
<li>A value (primitive or object) returned by each call
(<code>l</code>,
<code>o</code>,
<code>i</code>,
<code>t</code>, and
<code>s</code>).</li>
<li>Inputs to the call, all of which come from values produced in earlier statements.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Rearranging the above sequence, we can see these elements more clearly:
</p>
<pre class="code">
                  Result      StatementKind        Inputs
                  ======      =============        ======
statement 0:      l       =   new LinkedList       ()
statement 1:      o       =   new Object           ()
statement 2:                  addFirst             (l, o)
statement 3:      i       =   size                 (l)
statement 4:      t       =   new TreeSet          (l)
statement 5:      s       =   synchronizedSet      (t)
</pre>


The three elements of a statement map to the following classes in Randoop:

<ul>

<li>
<p>A <a href="javadoc/randoop/StatementKind.html">StatementKind</a>
represents the kind of operation that the statement
performs.
</p>
<p>
Randoop statements include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="javadoc/randoop/RMethod.html">RMethod</a> represents a particular
method call. This class is Randoop's analogue of Java
reflection's
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Method.html"><code>Method</code></a>
class, and adds additional
functionality useful to Randoop.
</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/randoop/RConstructor.html">RConstructor</a>
represents a constructor call.
</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="creating_sequence">Creating sequences</h3>

<p>
You can create sequences in a variety of ways. The first way is
via <i>extension</i>: take a sequence and add a new statement at the
bottom. Recall the example sequence:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  LinkedList l = new LinkedList();
  Object o = new Object();
  l.addFirst(o);
  int i = l.size();
  TreeSet t = new TreeSet(l);
  Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(t);
</pre>

<p>
Below is code that creates this sequence via extension.
</p>

<pre class="code">

  // First, create the StatementKinds we'll need.
  StatementKind newLL = RConstructor.getRConstructor(LinkedList.class.getConstructor());
  StatementKind newOb = RConstructor.getRConstructor(Object.class.getConstructor());
  StatementKind addFist = RMethod.getRMethod(LinkedList.class.getMethod("addFirst", Object.class));
  StatementKind size = RMethod.getRMethod(LinkedList.class.getMethod("size"));
  StatementKind newTS = RConstructor.getRConstructor(TreeSet.class.getConstructor(Collection.class));
  StatementKind syncS = RMethod.getRMethod(Collections.class.getMethod("synchronizedSet", Set.class));

  // Now, create the sequence by repeated extension.
  Sequence s = new Sequence();
  s = s.extend(newLL);
  s = s.extend(newOb);
  s = s.extend(addFist, s.getVariable(0), s.getVariable(1));
  s = s.extend(size,    s.getVariable(0));
  s = s.extend(newTS,   s.getVariable(0));
  s = s.extend(syncS,   s.getVariable(4));
</pre>

<p>
A couple notable points:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Sequences are <b>immutable</b>. The <code>extend</code> operation
returns a new sequence rather than modifying its receiver.</li>
<li> If the above code feels somewhat onerous, keep in mind that the
Sequences classes were designed for automatic generation, not to
create individual sequences by hand. The purpose of these examples is
to show you how sequences are created so that, if you need to, you can
create new automated generation techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A second way to create a sequence is using <code>concatenation</code>:
given sequences <code>s1</code>, <code>s2</code>, and <code>s3</code>,
you can create a new sequence that is the concatenation of the three
sequences.
</p>
<pre class="code">
List&lt;Sequence&gt; seqs = new ArrayList&lt;Sequence&gt;();
seqs.add(s1);
seqs.add(s2);
seqs.add(s3);
Sequence newSeq = Sequence.concatenate(seqs);
</pre>

<p>
If you're wondering why concatenation is useful, it is actually how
Randoop combines sequences to create new ones. To create a new
sequence that tests method <code>m(A a, B b)</code>, Randoop first
finds and concatenates previously-generated sequences that create
objects of type <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, and then extends
the concatenated sequence with a call of <code>m</code>. See
<a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/feedback-testgen-icse2007.pdf">Section
2.2. of this paper</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
A third way to create a sequence is by parsing it from a String. For
example, given a string <code>parseable</code> with the following contents:
</p>
<pre class="code">
var0 =  cons : java.util.LinkedList.&lt;init&gt;() :
var1 =  cons : java.lang.Object.&lt;init&gt;() :
var2 =  method : java.util.LinkedList.addFirst(java.lang.Object) : var0 var1
var3 =  method : java.util.LinkedList.size() : var0
var4 =  cons : java.util.TreeSet.&lt;init&gt;(java.util.Collection) : var0
var5 =  method : java.util.Collections.synchronizedSet(java.util.Set) : var4
</pre>
<p>
The following call creates a sequence corresponding to our
running-example sequence:
</p>
<pre class="code">
Sequence seq = Sequence.parse(parseable);
</pre>

<h2 id="executing_sequence">Executable Sequences</h2>

<p>
An <a href="javadoc/randoop/ExecutableSequence.html">ExecutableSequence</a>
 wraps a <code>Sequence</code> and adds two pieces of
 functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>An <code>ExecutableSequence</code> can be augmented with
checks of expected properties.</b>  A <a href="#checks">Check</a> is
an object that represents some <i>expected property</i> of a sequence;
for a example, that a specific method call in the sequence returns
normally. When an executable sequence is executed, any checks that are
present in the sequence are checked at runtime, and the
passing/failing status of the checks is available for the client to
inspect.
</li>
<li> <b>An <code>ExecutableSequence</code> can be executed.</b>
Randoop uses Java's reflection mechanism to call the methods and
constructors in the sequence, and uses the structure of the
underlying <code>Sequence</code> to determine what inputs to pass to
them.
</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="executing-a-sequence">Executing a sequence</h3>

<p>
Suppose we have created a Sequence <code>s</code> The following two
lines will execute the sequence:
</p>
<pre class="code">
ExecutableSequence es = new ExecutableSequence(s);
es.execute(null);
</pre>
<p>
After the <code>execute</code> method returns, you can access the
runtime objects created during execution via the <code>getResult(int
i)</code> method, which returns the result of executing
statement <code>i</code>. For example, assuming <code>s</code> refers
to our running-example sequence from above, the following code prints
out
<code>1</code>, i.e. the return value of the call to
method <code>LinkedList.size()</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code">
  ExecutableSequence es = new ExecutableSequence(s);
  es.execute(null);

  // Assuming statement at index 3 returned normally, print the runtime value
  ExecutionOutcome resultAt3 = es.getResult(3);
  if (resultAt3 instanceof NormalExecution) {
    System.out.println(((NormalExecution)resultAt3).getRuntimeValue());
  }
</pre>
<p>
To dig more into execution results, explore the
classes <a href="javadoc/randoop/Execution.html">Execution</a> and
<a href="javadoc/randoop/ExecutionOutcome.html">ExecutionOutcome</a>.
</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->

<ul>
<li>If the code under test prints to standard out,
then executing statements in a sequence may result in output
to standard out. Capturing this output is possible via
the method
<code>ExecutableSequence.executeStatement</code>.  This is
accomplished by changing stdout and stderr to a memory-based
PrintSteam and recording the results.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inout_sequence">Writing/reading sequences to file</h2>

<h4 id="writing_reading_serialized">Writing/reading serialized sequences</h4>
<p>
Writing a list of sequences to a serialized file:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  List&lt;ExecutableSequence&gt; sequences = ...;
  FileOutputStream fileos = new FileOutputStream("MyFile.gz");
  ObjectOutputStream objectos = new ObjectOutputStream(new GZIPOutputStream(fileos));
  objectos.writeObject(sequences);
  objectos.close();
  fileos.close();
</pre>
<p>
Any <a href="javadoc/randoop/Check.html">Checks</a> decorating the
sequences will also be serialized.
</p>
<p>
Reading a list of sequences from a serialized file:

  ObjectInputStream objectis = new ObjectInputStream(new GZIPInputStream(fileis));
  List&lt;ExecutableSequence&gt; seqsfromfile = (List&lt;ExecutableSequence&gt;) objectis.readObject();
</pre>
<p>
You can replay the execution of a deserialized sequence (including
evaluation of its Checks) by executing it with
a <a href="javadoc/randoop/ReplayVisitor.html">ReplayVisitor</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="writing_sequence_as_junit">Writing a sequence as a JUnit test</h4>
<p>
Writing a list of executed sequences as JUnit files:

  new JunitFileWriter(output_dir, junit_package_name, junit_classname, testsperfile);
  jfw.createJunitFiles(seq);
</pre>
<p>
If you want to modify Randoop's JUnit-generating code, here are places to look:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Class <code>randoop.JunitFileWriter</code> figures out how many JUnit classes/files
to write, how many tests to put in each, what to name them, etc.
  <ul>
  <li><code>randoop.JunitFileWriter.writeDriverFile</code> generates the non-reflective driver file</li>
  <li><code>randoop.JunitFileWriter.writeSuiteFile</code> generates the (reflective) test suite</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Methods responsible for writing the code for a single unit test:
  <ul>
  <li><code>randoop.ExecutableSequence.toCodeString()</code>,</li>
  <li>implementors of <code>randoop.ObjectContract</code>,</li>
  <li>implementors of <code>randoop.Check</code>,</li>
  <li>and the various implementations of <code>StatementKind.appendCode(...)</code></li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="checks">Checks</h2>

<p>
A <a href="javadoc/randoop/Check.html">Check</a> is an object that
represents an <b>expected property</b> of a sequence. In terms of
 <a href="#unit_tests">unit test concepts</a>, a check represents some
piece of checking code (or &ldquo;test oracle&rdquo;) of a unit test.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider the following unit test:
</p>
<pre class="code">
 1.  // Tests that the size of a list is 1 after adding an element.
 2.  @Test
 3.  public void testAdd() {
 4.     LinkedList l = new LinkedList();            // Create a list.
 5.     assertTrue(l.equals(l));                    // List should be equal to itself.
 6.     Object o = new Object();
 7.     boolean b = l.add(o);                       // Add an element to it.
 8.     org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(l.size() == 1); // List should have size 1.
 9.     org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(l.equals(l));   // List should still be equal to itself.
10.     int i = 10;
11.     try {
12.       Object o2 = l.remove(i);                  // Removing from invalid index
13.       org.junit.Assert.fail();                  // should throw exception.
14.     } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
15.       // expected exception.
16.     }
17.  }
</pre>
<p>
Like a typical unit test, this test combines <i>test input code</i>
(the code creating a list, adding an element to it, removing an
element, etc.)  with <i>checking code</i> (the code in lines 6-7
creating assertions, and the code in lines 9, 11-14 checking that the
correct exception is thrown). In Randoop, test input code is
represented as a <a href="#sequence">Sequence</a> and checking code is
represented by <code>Check</code>s associated with the sequence.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, each check is associated with an index in the
sequence, where the index represents the time at which the check
should be performed. For example, rearranging the above test to better
see its structure, we have:
</p>

<pre class="code">

                          Checks performed
Statement                 after statement
=========                 ===============
l  = new LinkedList()
                           l.equals(l) returns true.
o  = new Object()
                           no checks.
b  = l.add(o)
                           l.size() returns 1.
                           l.equals(l) returns true.
i = 10;
                           no checks.
o2 = l.remove(i)
                           throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.
</pre>
<p>
The example illustrates how Randoop represents a test input along with
its correctness checks.
</p>

<h3 id="distinction">Statements vs. Checks</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
<p>
Looking at the above example, you may reasonably ask: why do we draw a
distinction between &ldquo;test input code&rdquo; (the statements on the left) and
&ldquo;checking code&rdquo; (the statements on the right)? After all, aren't the
calls to <code>size</code> and <code>equals</code> in the checking
column also calls of the classes under test, and why not consider them
part of the test input?
</p>
<p>
We offer an answer in terms of how Randoop works. Randoop generates
test inputs (<a href="#sequence">Sequences</a>) <i> randomly</i>, by
combining and extending previously-generated sequences. On the other
hand, Randoop performs its checks <i>deterministically</i>. For every
sequence it creates, it performs checks on all the objects of the
sequence.
</p>
<p>
Given how Randoop treats sequences and checks differently, it makes
more sense for a call like <code>l.equals(l)</code> to be expressed as
a <a href="javadoc/randoop/Check.html">Check</a>, so that it is always
(not randomly) performed.
