===========================================================================

Carlos has some additional files squirreled away at:
  ~cpacheco/mac/carlospacheco/Documents/workspace/jrandoop/
  ~cpacheco/mac/carlospacheco/randoop2/jrandoop/
They are slightly different, so you may need to look in both places.

===========================================================================

The below are notes from Carlos's original notes.txt file.

first step is predf,  (make predf)
  runs randoop on java collections
  computes frontier branches
  creates input files for dataflow (each input file represents a frontier branch
    and all of the seqs that reach it)
  Stops when it sticks at the same branch coverage for N seconds
  The input files are in th form frontierNNN.gz

So files that begin with .df (eg, .df-jc-frontier9.gz) are timestamp
files.  But they are not dependent on the matching frontier files.
Use rm .df*.gz to get rid of them.

Need to add -DRANDOOP_MACHINES=$(machines) to each use
of randoop.experiments.MultiMachineRunner

make parallel-df runs all of the tests.  If you don't pass in machines
it will run only on the local machine.

To run just one, use 'make .df-jc-frontierNNN.gz'
