Local dependencies: (last updated on:  3/2/2016)

This is a list of jar files for dependencies that cannot be retrieved via
Gradle, and how they were obtained.  If you update a library, you should
also update, the library information in configuration blocks for plugins,
dependencies, and the Gradle wrapper task.  Those appear in these files:
  randoop/build.gradle
  randoop/agent/exercised-class/exercised-class.gradle


plume.jar: https://github.com/mernst/plume-lib/releases; version 1.0.9
Currently installed copy was locally generated to include changes to Options
doclet that includes a -d option to support the Gradle build. Also does not
include junit in jar file.
