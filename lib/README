Local dependencies: (last updated on:  2/8/2017)

This is a list of jar files for dependencies that cannot be retrieved via
Gradle, and how they were obtained.  If you update a library, you should
also update, the library information in configuration blocks for plugins,
dependencies, and the Gradle wrapper task.  Those appear in these files:
  randoop/build.gradle
  randoop/agent/covered-class/covered-class.gradle
  randoop/agent/mapcall/mapcall.gradle
