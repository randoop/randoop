PLUGIN BUGS

* TestGeneratorViewPart initially opens in wrong area. It should open
  in the Package Explorer / JUnit view area 

* Sometimes the "Run with JUnit" action is mistakenly enabled when
  Randoop throws an error immediately after launching
  
* The Randoop 'R' icon appears to be distorted in the launch shortcut
  in Galileo

* Randoop generated JUnit files are uncompilable from a non-default
  package if class-input from the default package is used.
  
* Sometimes the project does a full build when opening the launch
  dialog. This is very time-consuming and annoying (This may be done
  by Eclipse, not Randoop)

* If a user edits code by removing a class or changing parameters to a
  method that is used in a launch configuration, when they open the
  launch configuration there will be unsaved changes.
  [Many Eclipse plug-ins such as JUnit and PDE have the same issue.]
  REASON: The config stores methods so it knows what should be checked
          when the config is opened, but it checks if the methods are
          available before adding them to the list.
  SOLUTION: Probably the best way to fix this would be to have a refresh
            button that searches for changes, removes methods that don't
            exist, and adds new ones that have been added.

* Cannot run tests on methods with generic type parameters without testing
  the entire class.

* "Project Sources" dialog: When I first press "Project Sources", user
  presented with an empty window and no classes, and no indication of
  what user is to do. Should show a list of classes for the selected
  project, or something like that. Also, the Project Sources class
  selection dialog changes behavior on subsequent presses: it seems to
  remember which classes I searched for in earlier dialogs, and shows
  those classes in subsequent dialogs, which is confusing.

* As I use the plugin in an example use, many errors show up in the
  Error Log window of the test Eclipse application.

* Sometimes, pressing the "Regenerate tests" button results in NPE on
  MessageViewListener.

* There should be a more elegant way of handling Randoop erros such as:

Randoop failed.
Last sequence under execution:null

This error occurred when I tested JUnit tests with Randoop, and elected to delete them before launching. Randoop threw an error since their class files hadn’t yet been created yet.


FEATURE REQUESTS

* Plug-in should open a classpath fix proposal dialog immediately after
  generating tests if randoop and junit are not already in the classpath.
  
* Add button to remove all Randoop-generate files.

* Delete button should be able to remove selected classes from the class
  selector

* The state of the check button [ ] Ignore JUNit Tests should be remembered
