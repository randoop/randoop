<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="../../doc/index.html">Randoop</a> is an open source tool that
automatically generates units tests for Java classes. Tests are written in the
<a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm">JUnit format</a>
and consist of a sequence of constructor and method calls intermixed with
assersions about the expected return values of method calls.</p>

<p>Randoop executes the sequences it generates to create two kinds of tests:
regression tests and error-revealing tests. Regression tests always pass at the
time of creation and capture the current behavior of the program, whereas
error-revealing tests sometimes fail at the time of creation and show a specific
use of a class under test that leads to a contract violation. Randoop uses both
<a href="../../doc/index.html#error_revealing_tests">Java API contract checks</a>
and user-specified <a href="../../doc/index.html#checkrep">representation
invariant methods</a> to make assertions for error-revealing tests.</p>

<p>The Eclipse plug-in for Randoop aims to make it easy to rapidly configure
Randoop to generate tests. The plug-in shows Randoop's progress as well as any
contract failures that are discovered during execution. Each sequence that
uncovers a contract failure is written to a JUnit test file to ease debugging.
Randoop also outputs a set of JUnit tests, most of which are regression tests
that will pass on a first run with JUnit.</p>

<h2 id="Installation_Instructions">Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>The Randoop Eclipse plug-in requires Java 1.5 or later to run properly. The
plug-in supports both
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ganymede/">Eclipse 3.5 (Ganymede)</a> and
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/helios/">Eclipse 3.6 (Helios)</a>.
Other versions of Eclipse have not been tested, and may fail to install the
plug-in.</p>

<h3 id="Update_Site">Update Site</h3>
<p>
To install the plug-in, navigate to <b><i>Help</i> > <i>Install New Software</i></b> and 
add the Randoop update site to the available repositories:</p>
<pre class="code">
http://randoop.googlecode.com/hg/plugin.updateSite/
</pre>
<p>For more information on
adding new software, see the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-127.htm">
Eclipse documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="generating_tests">Generating Tests</h2>

<p><b><i>WARNING: the Randoop Eclipse plug-in does not restrict Randoop's
behavior. Testing code that modifies your file system might result in
Randoop generating tests that modify your file system! Be careful when choosing
classes and methods to test.</i></b>
</p>

<p>When creating a launch configuration, keep in mind that Randoop will only
generate tests using classes you specify. If some of your methods under test
take <tt>java.util.Collection</tt>s as parameters, then it is a good idea to
add Java collections such as <tt>ArrayList</tt> and <tt>HashSet</tt> to your
classes under test.</p>

<p>The Eclipse plug-in uses Randoop launch configurations to store classes and
methods under test as well as other parameters such as the time limit. New
launch configurations can be created and launched with the Randoop launch
shortcut or the Eclipse launch configuration dialog.</p>

<h3 id="Launch_shortcut">Launch shortcut</h3>
<p>The launch shortcut is the easiest way to create and launch a new Randoop
launch configuration. To launch with the shortcut, simply select elements to
test from the package explorer view, right click, and navigate to <b><i>Run As</i> >
<i>Randoop Test Input</i></b>.

The following elements may be used for test-input:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Methods of non-abstract classes.
</li>
<li>Non-abstract classes
</li>
<li>Enums
</li>
<li>Compilation units (<tt>.java</tt> files) containing <i>at least one</i> of
the above elements 
</li>
<li>Packages containing containing <i>at least one</i> of the above elements
</li>
<li>Source folders containing containing <i>at least one</i> of the above elements
</li>
</ul>

<p>If <i>all</i> of the selected Java elements are in the same project and <i>at
least one</i> of the selected elements is valid, the launch shortcut will be
visible. Alternatively, you can select a single Java project, which will add
every valid element in the project into the new launch configuration.
</p>

<br />Selecting test input and launching Randoop from the package explorer</div>

<p>After you have made a selection and pressed the shortcut, the plug-in
will open a wizard that allows further fine-tuning of the Randoop options
before launching Randoop. On the first page of the wizard, you can review your
selected class and method inputs. When adding new classes, the plug-in will open
a filtered class selection dialog. The class selection dialog will remain empty
until a pattern is typed into the text bar. You can use the string '*?' to show
all available classes, but the operation may take several seconds to complete.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/add_class.png" alt="Filtered class selection dialog" />

in the java.util package.</div>

<p>The Randoop wizard also allows you to edit the time limit and input limit as
well as more advanced parameters such as the random seed. For more information
on each option, simply hover over the option to read its tooltip, or consult the
<a href="../../doc/index.html">Randoop Manual</a>. Note that some options in the
plug-in are named slightly differently than those in the manual.
</p>

<td>Thread Timeout</td>

<tr>

<td>Use Null</td>

<tr>

<td>Maximum Tests per File</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 id="Launch_configuration_dialog">Launch configuration dialog</h3>
<p>Another way to create a new Randoop launch configuration is through the
launch configuration dialog. To open the dialog, navigate to <b><i>Run</i> >
<i>Run Configurations</i>...</b>, and click <b><i>Randoop Launcher</i></b> from the filtered
tree pane at left. From here, you can edit launch configurations using a similar
user interface to that used in the Randoop launch wizard. Launch configurations that are created using the wizard are automatically added to the launch configuration dialog.
</p>

<p>You can specify the Java project to work on in the <b><i>General</i></b> tab. This changes which
classpaths are used for searching for classes and changes what source folder is
used for outputing tests. Each class in the launch configuration is stored along
with the classpath it was found in. If you change the project, the
plug-in will search for the same exact classpath in the new project. For
example, if the classpath is a source folder, the plug-in will check if the new
project links to the same folder or has that folder's containing project in its
classpath. If the type cannot be found in the new project it is considered
missing. If you know there are copies of the missing classes in the new project,
you can click the <i>Resolve Missing Classes</i> button to search for classes with the
same full-qualified name as those that are missing.
</p>

<p>The launch configuration dialog also adds the <b><i>Arguments</i></b>
tab, which can be used to manually specify arguments for Randoop or the VM.
The text in the <i>Program arguments</i> box is passed as arguments to Randoop.
If there is a duplicate of an argument in the text box and the <i>Parameters</i>
tab that can take only one value, then the argument specified in the <i>Arguments</i>
tab will be used. For example, if "--timelimit=30" were written in the
<i>Program arguments</i> text box, then the time limit used for generating tests
would be 30 seconds, regardless of what was specified in the the <i>Parameters</i> tab.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/manager.png" alt="Run configuration dialog" />
<br />Changing the project or deleting compilation units might render some launch
configurations unlaunchable.</div>

<p>The Randoop Eclipse plug-in supports refactoring of source folder names,
package names, class names, and method names. If you use Eclipe's built in
refactoring tools, the changes will be reflected in your Randoop launch
confurations as well.
</p>

<h3 id="Randoop_View">Randoop View</h3>
<p>Once you launch Randoop by either pressing <i>Finish</i> in the wizard or <i>Run</i> in
the launch configuration dialog, the plug-in will open the Randoop view. The
Randoop view shows the progress of the test generation and a tree with any
failures that Randoop uncovers. You can double click on a failure to open a
JUnit test that isolates the cause of the failure.</p>

<p>It is also possible to run two Randoop configurations simultaniously.
However, only the results of the last one to run will be displayed in the view.
Once the view's contents have been replaced, the old contents are lost forever,
but the files will remain in the project. You can view and terminate active
Randoop launches from the Eclipse 
<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_dbg_view.htm">debug view</a>.
</p>

<p>The view can also be manually opened though <b>Window > Show View >
Other...</b> under Java > Randoop. When opened, the dialog will show the results
of the last Randoop launch unless Eclipse has been closed since then.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/view.png" alt="Run configuration dialog" /></div>

<h3 id="Output">Output</h3>

<p>Randoop will output all files to the selected source folder in the Java
project the tests are being generated for. The source folder will be created and
added to the Java project's classpath if it does not already exist. Randoop
outputs two sets of JUnit tests: a set of regression tests mixed with
error-revealing tests and a set of isolated error-revealing tests. The first set
of tests will be placed in
</p>

<pre class="code">
[project]/[outputdir]/[package/name]
</pre>

<p>and the files will be named <tt>[ClassName].java</tt>, <tt>[ClassName].java</tt>,
<tt>[ClassName].java</tt>, and so forth, where each <tt>[project]</tt>,
<tt>[outputdir]</tt>, <tt>[package/name]</tt>, and <tt>[ClassName]</tt> are
specified in the launch configuration. The second set of tests will be placed in
</p>

<pre class="code">
[project]/[outputdir]/randoopFailures
</pre>

<p>and be named <tt>[ClassName]_failure_1.java</tt>,
<tt>[ClassName]_failure_2.java</tt>, and so forth. These JUnit files will contain
one test each and be linked to by the Randoop view.
</p>

<div class="image">
